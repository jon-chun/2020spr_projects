Donald Trump: (09:24)
I’m glad to see that you’re practicing social distancing. That looks very nice. That’s very good. I want to thank everybody for being here today. This morning I spoke with the leaders of the G seven, G seven nations and they really had a good meeting. I think it was a very, very productive meeting. I also spoke with our nation’s governors, and this afternoon we’re announcing new guidelines for every American to follow over the next 15 days. As we combat the virus, each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping the spread and transmission of the virus. We did this today. This was done by a lot of very talented people, some of whom were standing with me, and that’s available.
--
Donald Trump: (10:16)
Dr. Birx will be speaking about that in just a few minutes. It’s important for the young and healthy people to understand that while they may experience milder symptoms, they can easily spread this virus and they will spread it indeed, putting countless others in harm’s way. We especially worry about our senior citizens. The White House task force meets every day and continually updates guidelines based on the fast evolving situation that this has become all over the world. It’s all over the world. It’s incredible what’s happened in such a short period of time. On the guidelines of the task force, the new modeling conducted by Dr. Birx and our consultation with governors, we’ve made the decision to further toughen the guidelines and blunt the infection now. We’d much rather be ahead of the curve than behind it and that’s what we are. Therefore, my administration is recommending that all Americans, including the young and healthy, work to engage in schooling from home when possible, avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people.
--
Donald Trump: (11:21)
Avoid discretionary travel and avoid eating and drinking at bars, restaurants, and public food courts. If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus and we’re going to have a big celebration altogether. With several weeks of focused action, we can turn the corner and turn it quickly and a lot of progress has been made. I’m also pleased to report today that a vaccine candidate has begun the phase one clinical trial. This is one of the fastest vaccine development launches in history, not even close. We’re also racing to develop antiviral therapies and other treatments and we’ve had some promising results, early results, but promising to reduce the severity and the duration of the symptoms. And I have to say that our government is prepared to do whatever it takes, whatever it takes we’re doing, and we’re doing it in every way. And with that I’d like to just introduce Dr. Birx, Who’s going to discuss some of the things that we strongly recommend. Thank you.
--
Donald Trump: (17:53)
Okay, go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (18:09)
My favorite question, I ask it all the time, how many times Anthony? I think I ask him that question every day and I speak to Debra, I speak to a lot of them. I get the opinion. So it seems to me that if we do a really good job, we’ll not only hold the death down to a level that is a much lower than the other way had we not done a good job, but people are talking about July, August, something like that. So it could be right in that period of time where I say it washes through, other people don’t like that term, but it washes through.
--
Donald Trump: (18:53)
We’ll see what happens. But they think August, could be July. It could be longer than that. But I’ve asked that question many, many times. Yes?
--
Donald Trump: (19:20)
I think they are very scared. I think they see that we’re doing a very professional job. We’ve been working with the governors and the frankly, the mayors, local government at every level. We have FEMA totally involved. FEMA has been … Usually we see FEMA for the hurricanes and the tornadoes. Now we have FEMA involved in this. They’ve been doing a fantastic job locally, working with people that they know because they work, like as an example, in California, in the state of Washington, they work with them a lot on other things and they’re very familiar, so they’re working on it. What you can do and all you can do is professional, totally competent. We have the best people in the world. We have really the greatest experts in the world and someday soon hopefully it’ll end and we’ll be back to where it was, but this came up … We came up so suddenly look, you were surprised. We were all surprised. We heard about it.
--
Donald Trump: (20:14)
We heard about reports from China that something was happening and all of a sudden we did make a good decision. We closed our borders to China very quickly, very rapidly. That was … Otherwise we’d be in a very, as Tony has said numerous times, we’d be in a very bad position, much worse than we would be right now. You’re looking at what’s happening in other countries. Italy is having a very hard time, but I think that what we do, and I’ve spoken actually with my son, he says, “How bad is this?” It’s bad. It’s bad, but we’re going to, we’re going to be hopefully a case not a worst case and that’s what we’re working for. Yes?
--
Donald Trump: (21:03)
Well, we have that very much. Yeah, we have that very much and we are … We’ve been pretty aggressive. We were early with Europe but we were very, very early with China and other places and fortunately we were. And as far as containment here, we are. We’re coming out with strong suggestions and it’s becoming a little bit automatic. You look at people, they’re not doing certain things. For instance, obviously not … I wouldn’t say the restaurant business is booming and bars and grills and all. People are self- containing for to a large extent. We look forward to the day when we can get back to normal. What’s your second question?
--
Donald Trump: (21:46)
At this point, not nationwide, but, well, there was some point … Some places in our nation that are not very effected at all, but we may look at certain areas, certain hotspots, as they call them. We’ll be looking at that, but at this moment, no, we’re not.
--
Donald Trump: (22:03)
… call them. We’ll be looking at that. But at this moment, no, we’re not.
--
Donald Trump: (22:14)
I had my test. It was late Friday night. The reason I did it was because the … I had no symptoms whatsoever. The doctor said, “You have no symptoms so we don’t see any reason.” But when I did the press conference on Friday, everybody was going crazy. “Did you do the test? Did you do the test?” Very late on Friday night I did the test. The doctor may have put out something. I don’t know what time the letter went out. Maybe it was put out by somebody else, but the results came back I believe the following day. We tested negative.
--
Donald Trump: (22:53)
I told them that and I went totally by what they said, the doctors, more than one. They said you don’t have any of the symptoms. They checked what you’re supposed to check and that I didn’t have symptoms, but I did a test late on Friday night. It came back probably 24 hours later or something. They sent it to the labs. It came back later. Yeah, please.
--
Donald Trump: (23:25)
If they can get them faster by getting them on their own, in other words, go through a supply chain that they may have. Because the governors during normal times, the governors buy a lot of things, not necessarily through federal government. If they’re able to get ventilators, respirators, if they’re able to get certain things without having to go through the longer process of federal government.
--
Donald Trump: (23:45)
We have stockpiles now where we’re ordering tremendous numbers of ventilators, respirators, masks, and they’re ordered. They’re coming. We have quite a few at this point. I think, Mike, we have a lot. But if they can get them directly, it’s always going to be faster if they could get them directly if they need them. I’ve given them authorization to order directly.
--
Donald Trump: (24:15)
That’s right.
--
Donald Trump: (24:33)
First of all, we hope we don’t get there. That’s what we’re doing. That’s why we’re taking a very strict look at this. But we also are looking at areas and not only looking, we’re expanding certain areas. We’re taking over buildings that aren’t used. We’re doing a lot in that regard. We hope we don’t have to get there, but we are doing a lot in that regard.
--
Donald Trump: (25:16)
We’re looking at that and we may be expanding that. We are looking at that.
--
Donald Trump: (25:19)
We want fairness. We want it for everybody. No, we’re looking at that through the Senate, because as you know the Senate is now digesting that bill.
--
Donald Trump: (25:26)
We may very well be adding something on that. Good question.
--
Donald Trump: (25:38)
I could get back to you with that number. We’ve ordered a lot. We have quite a few, but it may not be enough. If it’s not enough, we will have it by the time we need it. Hopefully we won’t need them.
--
Donald Trump: (25:48)
Yeah, we’ll be able to give you-
--
Donald Trump: (25:51)
We can give you a number. If it’s important, we’ll give you a number. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (26:05)
When I’m talking about control, I’m saying we are doing a very good job within the confines of what we’re dealing with. We’re doing a very good job. There’s been a tremendous amount of the way they’re working together. They’re working hand-in-hand. I think they’re doing really a great job. From that standpoint, that’s what I was referring to yesterday. Yeah, Steve, go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (26:27)
I’m not referring to it. Meaning the-
--
Donald Trump: (26:30)
Yeah, if you’re talking about the virus, no. That’s not under control for any place in the world. I think I read-
--
Donald Trump: (26:35)
I think I read … no, I didn’t. I was talking about what we’re doing is under control, but I’m not talking about the virus.
--
Donald Trump: (26:40)
Yes, please.
--
Donald Trump: (26:46)
Well, it may be. We’re not thinking in terms of recession. We’re thinking in terms of the virus. Once we stop I think there’s a tremendous pent-up demand both in terms of the stock market, in terms of the economy. Once this goes away, once it goes through and we’re done with it, I think you’re going to see a tremendous, a tremendous surge.
--
Donald Trump: (27:10)
We’re not really. We hope we don’t have to, Steve. We think that hopefully we won’t have to do that. But it’s certainly something that we talk about every day. We haven’t made that decision.
--
Donald Trump: (27:40)
I think the federal government’s doing everything that we can possibly do. We made some very good early decisions by keeping people out, by keeping countries out, certain countries where the infection was very immense. I noticed a lot of people are talking about South Korea because they’ve a good job on one side, but on the other side, tremendous problems at the beginning. They had tremendous problems and great numbers of death. I think that we’ve done a fantastic job from just about every standpoint.
--
Donald Trump: (28:09)
With that being said, no matter where you look, this is something. It’s an invisible enemy. But we are speaking all the time, not only with the people, but also the professional people, the nurses, the doctors, they have been doing a fantastic job. We are also working very much on getting them the kind of equipment that they need. For the most part, they either have it or they will be getting it.
--
Donald Trump: (28:33)
But remember this, we want the governors, we want the mayors, we want them locally, from a local standpoint because it can go quicker, we want them to work. We had a great talk with the governors today. I think it was a really great talk. There’s a tremendous coordination. There’s a tremendous spirit that we have together with the governors. That’s pretty much for the most part, bipartisan. Yeah.
--
Donald Trump: (29:09)
I don’t number one determine recession. I just say this. We have an invisible enemy. We have a problem that a month ago nobody ever thought about. I’ve read about it. I read about many years ago, 1917, 1918. I’ve seen all of the different problems similar to this that we’ve had. This is a bad one. This is a very bad one. This is bad in the sense that it’s so contagious. It’s just so contagious, sort of a record setting-type contagion. The good part is the young people they do very well and healthy people do very well. Very, very bad for older people, especially older people with problems. My focus is really on getting rid of this problem, this virus problem. Once we do that, everything else is going to fall into place. Yes, please.
--
Donald Trump: (30:17)
I’ve been watching.
--
Donald Trump: (30:25)
I don’t know. That I can’t tell you if they are or not. I think a lot of the media actually has been very fair. I think people are pulling together on this. I really think the media has been very fair. I think it could be that you have some foreign groups that are playing games, but it doesn’t matter. We haven’t really determined to do that at all and hopefully we won’t have to. That’s a very big step. It’s a step we can take, but we have not decided to do it. Jennifer, go.
--
Donald Trump: (31:07)
I’ve heard that’s true. I don’t know that for a fact, but I know that some of my people have, as I understand it, have been dealing with them or with him. That’s nice. We’ve had tremendous support from a lot of people that can help. I believe he was one of them.
--
Donald Trump: (31:23)
As far as the airlines are concerned, were going to back the airlines 100%. it’s not their fault. It’s nobody’s fault unless you go to the original source, but it’s nobody’s fault. We’re going to be in a position to help the airlines very much. We’ve told the airlines we’re going to help them.
--
Donald Trump: (31:42)
We’re going to be helping. We’re going to be backstopping the airlines. We’re going to be helping them very much, John. It’s very important.
--
Donald Trump: (31:53)
We’re going to be looking at it very strongly. We have to back the airlines. It’s not their fault. In fact, they were having a record season. Everybody was. They were having record seasons. Then this came out and it came out from nowhere. Not their fault, but we’re going to be back the airline. Yeah.
--
Donald Trump: (32:11)
Best thing I can do for the stock market is we have to get through this crisis. That’s what I can do. That’s the best thing we can do. That’s what I think about. Once this virus has gone, I think you’re going to have a stock market like nobody’s ever seen before.
--
Donald Trump: (32:24)
Oh, okay.
--
Donald Trump: (32:56)
Yeah. That would be the outside number.
--
Donald Trump: (33:01)
Hold on one second. Please, go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (33:11)
I think they may make it even better. Look, they’re working together very well with the House. They are working very much in unison, like the question before. They’re working to only enhance it and make it better and make it fair for everybody. That’s what we’re looking to do. We may go back and forth with the House a little bit, but both will be in a very positive fashion. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (33:54)
Let me just have the professionals answer that. Would you like to do that? Please.
--
Donald Trump: (35:26)
Go ahead, Yes, Mike.
--
Donald Trump: (37:58)
Admiral, perhaps you could-
--
Donald Trump: (38:05)
I think the admiral can answer that and you might want to talk about the roving also.
--
Donald Trump: (41:14)
I think just to put it a different way, a lot of testing has been going on. I don’t believe anybody has been able to do what we’re doing and what we will be doing.
--
Donald Trump: (42:20)
This has never been done before. That’s never been done and certainly not on a level like that. I will say that I think I can speak for the professionals that if you don’t have the symptoms, if your doctor doesn’t think you need it, don’t get the test. Don’t get the test. I think that’s very important. Not everybody should run out and get the test, but we’re able to handle tremendous numbers of people.
--
Donald Trump: (42:43)
John?
--
Donald Trump: (42:59)
We’re looking into it. We’ve heard that. We’ve heard it from really two places. There are two places that have specifically, New York being one. We are looking into it very strongly. Yeah.
--
Donald Trump: (43:11)
Steve, go ahead please.
--
Donald Trump: (43:18)
I’ve always washed my hands a lot. I wash my hands a lot. Maybe, if anything, more, certainly not less.
--
Donald Trump: (43:28)
Not something I want to do every day. I can tell you that. It’s a little bit of … good doctors in the White House, but it’s a test. It’s a test. It’s a medical test. Nothing pleasant about it.
--
Donald Trump: (43:53)
I think he can do more.
--
Donald Trump: (43:55)
I think he can do more. It’s an area of the country that’s very hot right now. I think New Rochelle, a place I know very well. I grew up right near New Rochelle.
--
Donald Trump: (44:02)
Place I know very well. I grew up right near New Rochelle. I think it’s a very, no I think it’s an area that has to be tamped down even more. Because it’s a hotbed. There’s no question about it. So I think they could look at doing it. But we’re getting along very well. We’ve had a very, in fact, I noticed he made some statements just now that the relationship with the federal government has been good. That federal government has done everything they’ve wanted us to do.
--
Donald Trump: (44:25)
But we can, I think it’s very important that all of the governors get along very well with us. And that we get along with the governors and I think that’s happening.
--
Donald Trump: (44:52)
Well, we haven’t thought of it. But you know, I will say this, we’re very careful. We’re very careful with being together. Even the people behind me they’ve been very strongly tested. I’ve been very strongly tested and we have to be very careful. But everybody should be very vigilant. We have to be vigilant. Yeah please.
--
Donald Trump: (45:20)
Go ahead please.
--
Donald Trump: (45:20)
Hold it, hold it. Before you.
--
Donald Trump: (47:42)
I’d rate it a ten. I think we’ve done a great job. And it started with the fact that we kept a very highly infected country despite, even the professionals saying, “No, it’s too early to do that.” We were very, very early with respect to China. And we would have a whole different situation in this country. If we didn’t do that. I would rate ourselves and the professional. I think the professionals have done a fantastic job.
--
Donald Trump: (48:10)
As far as the testing. You heard the Admiral, I think the testing that we’ve done. We really took over an obsolete system. Or put it maybe in a different way, a system that wasn’t meant to do anything like this. We took it over and we’re doing something that’s never been done in this country. And I think that we are doing very well. We took the system, we worked with the system we had and we broke down the system purposely. We broke it down in order to do what we’re doing now. And within a short period of time and even now we’re testing tremendous numbers of people. And ultimately you’re saying, it will be what? It will be up to how many people will be able to test?
--
Donald Trump: (49:54)
Yeah, normally. But I think when you hear the, “This has never been done before in this country.” If you look back take a look at some of the things that took place in ’09 or ’11 or whatever it may have been nobody’s ever done anything like what we’re doing. Now. I will also say Admiral, I think we can say that we’re also getting this ready for the future. So that when we have a future problem, if and when, and hopefully we don’t have anything like this. But if there is, we’re going to be starting off from a much higher plateau. Because we were at a very, very low base. We had a system that was not meant for this. It was a smaller system. It was meant for a much different purpose and for that purpose it was fine. But not for this purpose. So we broke down the system and now we have something that’s going to be and is very special and is ready for future problems. I think we can say that very strongly. Yeah.
--
Donald Trump: (50:47)
Go ahead please.
--
Donald Trump: (51:06)
Well, I’d leave that up to the states. It’s a big thing. Postponing an election. I think to me that really goes to the heart of what we’re all about. I think postponing and elections is a very tough thing I know they’re doing, because they’ve been in touch with us, they’re doing it very carefully. They’re spreading people out at great distances as you can see. And I think they’ll do it very safely. I hope they do it very safely, but I think postponing elections is not a very good thing. They have lots of room and a lot of the electoral places. And I think that they will do it very well, but I think postponing is unnecessary.
--
Donald Trump: (51:43)
We think about it. We think about it. If we don’t have to do it, that’ll be good. We have very strong emergency powers when it comes to something like this, both on the Southern and the Northern borders. And we are talking about different things, but we’ll see. Right now we have not decided to do that. Steve.
--
Donald Trump: (53:13)
Go ahead please.
--
Donald Trump: (53:53)
Yeah, no the marked will take care of itself. The market will be a very strong as soon as we get rid of the virus. Yes.
--
Donald Trump: (55:10)
I haven’t heard that. I haven’t heard that from Devin or anybody else.
--
Donald Trump: (55:16)
Well I have to see what they said. But-
--
Donald Trump: (55:20)
Well, I would disagree with it. But right now we don’t have an order one way or the other. We don’t have an order, but I think it’s probably better that you don’t. Especially in certain areas, Oklahoma doesn’t have a tremendous problem. You said the Governor of Oklahoma?
--
Donald Trump: (55:36)
And Devin.
--
Donald Trump: (55:37)
Yeah, well I had heard that.
--
Donald Trump: (55:41)
[crosstalk 00:55:41] I would said verse to what the professionals are saying.
--
Donald Trump: (55:45)
Yeah.
--
Donald Trump: (55:48)
I’ll take a look at it. Absolutely.
--
Donald Trump: (56:51)
Do you want to answer that?
--
Donald Trump: (57:42)
Well we haven’t said that yet.
--
Donald Trump: (57:43)
We’re recommending but-
--
Donald Trump: (57:44)
… we’re recommending things. No, we haven’t gone to that step yet. That could happen, but we haven’t gone there yet. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (58:04)
Well hopefully it will pas through and hopefully everybody will be going to restaurants and flying and being on cruise ships and all of these different things that we do. And it will very, very hopefully be at a fairly quick period of time. But we’re taking a tough stance. We may make certain other decisions, we may enhance those decisions. We’re going to find out as per the question that you were asking, some of those decisions may be hence. How about one more? Jennifer.
--
Donald Trump: (58:35)
Yeah.
--
Donald Trump: (59:30)
One thing Mike just said, it’s very important to get out that this is for the next, much of what we’re talking about is for the next 15 days. Mike go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:08)
Just one more. Steve go ahead please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:08)
Yeah.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:08)
We had a G7.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:16)
It was-
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:19)
It looks like it.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:22)
I am very confident. They’re in a position that some of them are in a rough position. If you look at a couple of them. And some are heading toward pretty rough territory. We had a very good a conference. It was a teleconference. Everybody was on the phone, every leader. And almost a hundred percent was devoted to the subject that we’re talking about today. And they are working very hard and they’re very concerned obviously, but they’re working very hard. But I would say just about all of it was Steve, all of it was devoted to what we’re talking about.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:59)
I think so. I mean so far it seems, we didn’t even discuss that. It’s still a ways off. But it was a very good discussion and there’s a great comradery. There’s a great togetherness. I think I can say that very, very strongly. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (04:25)
Thank you very much. I had a very good telephone conversation, extremely good with Senator Schumer a little while ago. We’re working on various elements of the deal and the Democrats are very much wanting something to happen and the Republicans likewise are very much wanting something to happen. And I think it will. I spoke at length with Mitch McConnell and there’s tremendous spirit to get something done, so we’ll see what happens. But my conversation was very good with Senator Schumer. I thank you all for joining us and I’d like to begin by providing an update on what we are doing to minimize the impact of the Chinese virus on our nations students. With many schools closed due to the virus, the Department of Education will not enforce standardized testing requirements. Very importantly for students in elementary through high school, for the current year. They’ve been through a lot.
--
Donald Trump: (05:26)
They’ve been going back and forth, schools open, schools not open. It’s been all standardized testing and we’re not going to be enforcing that. So I think you can let the people know. I think probably a lot of the students would be extremely happy. Some probably not. The ones that work hard, maybe not, but it’s one of those things. Unfortunately, very unfortunate circumstance. We’ve also temporarily waived all interest on federally held student loans. There’ll be very happy to hear that. And I’ve instructed them to take that action immediately. And today, Secretary DeVos has directed federal lenders to allow borrowers to suspend their student loans and loan payments without penalty for at least the next 60 days. And if we need more, we’ll extend that period of time. Borrowers should contact their lenders, but we’ve given them very strong instruction so we’ve temporarily waved all interest on federally held student loans.
--
Donald Trump: (06:29)
That’s a big thing. That’s going to make a lot of students very happy. And we have more to come on student loans. More good news for the students, but we’ll do that at a different time. This morning the Treasury Department also announced that we’re moving tax day from April 15th to July 15th. So we’re moving it out to July 15th so that people will have time and people will be able to, hopefully by that time we’ll have people getting back to their lives. Families and businesses will have this extra time to file with no interest or penalties. We’re getting rid of interest and penalties. However, if you have refunds or credits you’d like to claim, you may still file. In other words, you can file early if you are owed money by the IRS. Other than that, we’re moving it all the way out to July 15th. No interest, no penalties.
--
Donald Trump: (07:23)
Your new date will be July 15th. Today, our team will also provide an update on our continuing effort to prevent the transmission of virus across America’s borders. And I watched what’s been happening in California with Governor Newsome and this morning with Governor Cuomo, and I applaud them. They’re taking very strong bold steps and I applaud them. And we’re all working together. We’re working very closely together, including those two governors. But, I would say based on the call, the media was there. I think we can say that with respect to virtually every governor in that call, I think every governor, we had almost all of them, if not all of them. And I would say that you could see for yourselves that the level of respect and [inaudible 00:08:14] core working together was extraordinary. There was nobody angry, nobody upset. We’re able to help them and that’s what we’re all about.
--
Donald Trump: (08:23)
We want to help. We’re doing things that a lot of people wouldn’t be able to do. But the relationship with governors in states is I think very extraordinary, especially under the circumstances where this just came upon us. We’re working with Canada and Mexico to prevent the spread of the virus across North America very closely. You heard what we did yesterday with Canada and Secretary of State Pompeo will be making a statement in a little while having to do with Mexico and the border. And Chad, likewise, Chad Wolf will likewise be making a statement. There’s a joint comprehensive effort in collaboration with our neighbors. The measure and all of those measures that we’re putting in place will protect the health of all three nations and reduce the incentive for a mass global migration that would badly deplete the healthcare resources needed for our people. And so we are working very closely with Mexico. Very, very closely with Canada and the relationship’s never been better.
--
Donald Trump: (09:34)
We’re all working for the same, toward the same goal. Our nation’s top healthcare officials are extremely concerned about the great public health consequences of mass, uncontrolled cross border movement. And that would be mostly, and even beyond, but mostly during this global pandemic. Every week our boarder agents encounter thousands of unscreened, unvetted and unauthorized entries from dozens of countries. And we’ve had this problem for decades. For decades. You know the story. But now it’s with the national emergencies and all of the other things that we’ve declared, we can actually do something about it. We’re taking a very strong hold of that. And we have before, but this is now at a level that nobody’s ever approached. In normal times these massive flows place a vast burden on our healthcare system, but during a global pandemic, they threaten to create a perfect storm that would spread the infection to our border agents, migrants, and to the public at large.
--
Donald Trump: (10:41)
Left unchecked, this would cripple our immigration system, overwhelm our healthcare system, and severely damage our national security. We’re not going to let that happen. So we have a lot of information and they’ll be discussing that in a moment. To confront these public health degrees, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has decided to exercise its authority under the Title 42 of the US Code to give customs and border protection the tools it needs to prevent the transmission of the virus coming through both the Northern and the Southern border. So we’re treating the borders equally. The Northern border and the Southern border. They’re both being treated equally. A lot of people say that they’re not treated equally. Well, they are. As we did with Canada, we’re also working with Mexico to implement new rules at our ports of entry to suspend non-essential travel. These new rules and procedures will not impede lawful trade and commerce.
--
Donald Trump: (11:45)
Furthermore, Mexico is taking action to secure our own Southern border and suspend air travel from Europe. So we’re coordinating very closely, the air travel going to Mexico and then trying to come into the United States. The actions we’re taking together with our North American partners will save countless lives. At the conclusion of my remarks, Secretary Azar, Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Wolf, we’re going to be also taking some questions with Tony and Deborah, who you’ve gotten to know very well. But, there’ll be discussing certain things and I think you’ll find them of great interest. We’re going to be providing tremendous amounts of detail over the coming days, but a lot of it will be provided right now, if you’d like to find out about it. There’s been a week of resolute action, tremendous action, tremendous relationships have developed with people that frankly didn’t get along. People that didn’t like each other.
--
Donald Trump: (12:49)
They’re now working together and maybe even in some cases learning about each other and liking each other. It’s a nice thing. I invoked the Defense Production Act and last night we put it into gear. We moved the National Response Coordination Center to the highest level of activity. I mean, if you take a look at what we did, the level of activation has been increased to a grade one level, which is the highest level. We’re providing historic support to small businesses and to the states. The states need support. Normally, they’d this themselves, but because of the magnitude of it, the federal government has gotten very much involved in terms of getting the equipment they need. So we’re helping them. It’s a responsibility they have, but we are helping the states a lot. That’s why the governors, I think in every case, have been impressed and very nice.
--
Donald Trump: (13:49)
We enacted legislation guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers at no cost to employers. And I think it’s very important, so they get paid sick leave at no cost to employers. We’re accelerating the use of new drug treatments. We’re advancing legislation to give direct payments to hardworking families. Throughout our country Americans from all walks of life are rallying together to defeat the unseen enemy striking our nation. In times of struggle, we see the true greatness of the American character. And we are seeing that. A lot of people are talking about it. We’re at 141 countries from what they’re telling me, and some of those countries, they’re really working in a unified manner and they’re working very unified with us. Almost, I could say, a good number of them. Doctors and nurses are working nonstop to heal the sick citizens. And churches are delivering meals to the needy.
--
Donald Trump: (14:48)
Truckers are making the long haul to keep shelves stocked. We’ve been dealing with the big stores and the big chains, Walmart, they’ve been fantastic and others, they’ve all been fantastic. We’ve made it much easier for them to stock in terms of travel and travel restrictions. We’re lifting restrictions so they can get their trucks on time. You’re seeing very few empty shelves and yet the amount of volume that they’re doing is unprecedented because people want to have what they have to have, what they feel they have to have. And they’re also buying in slightly smaller quantities, which is good, because we’re not going anywhere. We’re going to be here. So I want to thank all of those very great companies for working so well. Americans from every walk of life are coming together and thanks to the spirit of our people, we will win this war and we are, we’re winning and we’re going to win this war.
--
Donald Trump: (15:42)
America will triumph. And America will rise higher than ever before. We’ll be stronger than ever before. And we’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned a lot about relying on other countries. And I can say that I think in both a very good and a very bad way. Some good things came out of it and some not so good things came out of it. So I’d like to move now to invite our team to provide information on the new measures to prevent viral spread at our borders. And I’ll start by asking Secretary of State Pompeo to speak. He’s doing a fantastic job. And like everyone else, he’s been working very, very long and very, very hard, and he’s doing the other more normal jobs of a great Secretary of State. But, he got tied into this like everybody else and he’s been really doing a fantastic job. Mike, please.
--
Donald Trump: (20:04)
Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much. And we’ll take questions right after this. Chad Wolf.
--
Donald Trump: (24:00)
Thank you. Thank very much, Chad. Thank you. Secretary.
--
Donald Trump: (27:18)
Thank you very much. [inaudible 00:27:22] Tony or Deb?
--
Donald Trump: (30:17)
Thank you very much. Tony? Good.
--
Donald Trump: (32:14)
Thank you, Tony. Mike?
--
Donald Trump: (38:14)
Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you.
--
Donald Trump: (38:19)
Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (38:32)
It is. I did it yesterday. We invoked it, I think, the day before. We signed it the evening of the day before, and voted yesterday. We have a lot of people working very hard to do ventilators and various other things, yes.
--
Donald Trump: (38:49)
We are. For certain things that we need, including some of the very important emergency … I would say ventilators, probably more masks, to a large extent. We have millions of masks which are coming, and which will be distributed to the states. The states are having a hard time getting them, so we’re using the act. The act is very good for things like this. We have millions of masks that we’ve ordered. They will be here soon. We’re having them shipped directly to states.
--
Donald Trump: (39:26)
No, it’s no different other than we need certain equipment that the states are unable to get by themselves, so we’re invoking it to use the powers of the federal government to help the states get things that they need like the masks, like the ventilators. Yes, [Steve 00:14:42]?
--
Donald Trump: (39:50)
I don’t think so. Essentially you’ve done that in California, you’ve done that in New York. Those are really two hotbeds. Those are probably the two hottest of them all in terms of hotspots. I don’t think so, because you go out to the Midwest, you go out to other locations, and they’re watching it on television, but they don’t have the same problems. They don’t have by any means the same problem.
--
Donald Trump: (40:12)
New York, California. Miami, the governor’s doing an excellent job, Governor DeSantis in Florida. We have some pretty hot spots in Florida too, and the state of Washington, of course. But that was largely, if you look at it, it was one nursing home that had problems like you wouldn’t believe.
--
Donald Trump: (40:31)
No, we’re working with the governors. I don’t think we’ll ever find that necessary.
--
Donald Trump: (40:41)
I am happy. I am happy with it. We’ll have to see what the results are at the end of 14 days, let’s say. We’ll know by the 15th day, to see what we do.
--
Donald Trump: (40:50)
I’m certainly honored by the way the American people are working, because it’s work. It’s work not to work. This is the first time this has ever happened. We’re working on a tremendous financial package for them so they don’t work. Whoever heard of this? Usually you work out a financial package to get people working. We’re asking people not to work. Social distancing, that new term that’s become probably the hottest term there is. No, I’m very honored by the way the American people are are taking this so seriously. Yes, [Jim 00:00:41:23]?
--
Donald Trump: (41:39)
I think that really all of that is being discussed right now. We talked about, as an example, stock buybacks. I don’t want to have stock buybacks. I don’t want some executive saying, “We’re going to buy 200,000 shares of stock.” I want that money to be used for the workers, and also for the company to keep the company going, but not for buybacks. I haven’t spoken to a lot of the Republicans or Democrats on it. We discussed it. I don’t like buybacks. I didn’t like them the first time.
--
Donald Trump: (42:12)
We’re discussing that. We’re discussing many things.
--
Donald Trump: (42:16)
We’re not so far away. I’ll tell you, we’re not very far away.
--
Donald Trump: (43:18)
I think, without seeing too much, I’m probably more of a fan of that, maybe, than anybody. I’m a big fan, and we’ll see what happens. We all understand what the doctor said is 100% correct. It’s early, but I’ve seen things that are impressive. We’ll see. We’re going to know soon. We’re going to know soon. Including safety. When you get that safety, this has been prescribed for many years for people to combat malaria, which was a big problem, and it’s very effective. It’s a strong drug.
--
Donald Trump: (43:56)
It was, as I understand that … Is that a correct statement? It was fairly effective on SARS?
--
Donald Trump: (44:37)
We were ordering … Yes, we have millions of units ordered. Bayer is one of the companies, as you know, big company, very big, very great company. Millions of units are ordered. We’re going to see what happens.
--
Donald Trump: (44:51)
We’re going to be talking to the governors about it, and the FDA is working on it right now. The advantage is that it has been prescribed for a totally different problem, but it has been described for many years. Everybody knows the levels of the negatives and the positives. But, I will say that I am a man that comes from a very positive school when it comes to, in particular, one of these drugs.
--
Donald Trump: (45:17)
We’ll see how it works out, [Peter 00:00:45:18]. I’m not saying it will, but I think that people may be surprised. By the way, that would be a game changer. We’re going to know very soon. We have ordered millions of units. It’s being ordered from Bayer, and there is another couple of companies also that do it.
--
Donald Trump: (45:42)
I think we only disagree a little bit.
--
Donald Trump: (45:44)
I disagree. Maybe and maybe not. Maybe there is, maybe there isn’t. We have to see. We’re going to known soon.
--
Donald Trump: (45:57)
No, I don’t think so. I think got-
--
Donald Trump: (46:05)
Such a lovely question. Look, it may work, and it may not work. I agree with the doctor, what he said. May work, may not work. I feel good about it. That’s all it is. Just a feeling. I’m a smart guy. I feel good about it. We’re going to see.
--
Donald Trump: (46:21)
You’re going to see soon enough. We have certainly some very big samples of people. If you look at the people, you have a lot of people that are in big trouble. This is not a drug that, obviously, I think I can speak from a lot of experience, because it’s been out there for over 20 years. It’s not a drug that you have a huge amount of danger with. It’s not a brand-new drug that’s been just created, that may have an unbelievable monumental effect like kill you. We’re going to know very soon.
--
Donald Trump: (46:51)
I can tell you, the FDA’s working very hard to get it out. Right now, in terms of malaria, if you want it, you can have a prescription. You get a prescription. By the way, and it’s very effective. It works.
--
Donald Trump: (47:03)
I have a feeling you may … I’m not being overly optimistic or pessimistic. I sure as hell think we ought to give it a try. There’s been some interesting things happened, and some very good things. Let’s see what happens. We have nothing to lose. You know the expression? What the hell do you have to lose?
--
Donald Trump: (47:26)
John, go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (47:38)
I say that you’re a terrible reporter. That’s what I say. I think it’s a very nasty question, and I think it’s a very bad signal that you’re putting out to the American people. The American people are looking for answers and they’re looking for hope, and you’re doing sensationalism. The same with NBC and Comcast. I don’t call it Comcast, I called Concast, for who you work.
--
Donald Trump: (48:01)
Let me just tell you something. That’s really bad reporting, and you ought to get back to reporting instead of sensationalism. Let’s see if it works. It might and it might not. I happen to feel good about it, but who knows? I’ve been right a lot. Let’s see what happens.
--
Donald Trump: (48:18)
John?
--
Donald Trump: (48:21)
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
--
Donald Trump: (50:36)
I agree.
--
Donald Trump: (50:48)
My message to the American people is that there is a very low incidence of death. You understand that and we’re going to come through this stronger than ever before. If you get it, if you happen to get it, it is highly unlikely. It’s looking like it’s getting to a number. That’s much smaller than people originally thought in terms of the ultimate problem, which would be death. My message to the American people is, number one, you’ve done an incredible job, incredible what you’ve gone through. It wasn’t their fault. It wasn’t the fault of 140 other countries where this has happened and there is tremendous hope and I think we’re going to come out stronger, better, bigger in every way.
--
Donald Trump: (51:35)
I think we’re going to be a better country than we were before. And we learned a lot. We learned on reliance who to rely on who not to rely on. Our country has been incredible the way they pulled together, including the fact that I just spoke to Senator Schumer. We had a wonderful conversation. We both want to get to a good solution, but it’s been a really, for me, watching and seeing people that weren’t speaking, getting along well because we all have one common aim and that’s to get rid of this invisible enemy. Get rid of it fast, and then go back to the kind of economy that we had. And maybe even better. Yeah, please in the back. No, the back, please.
--
Donald Trump: (52:25)
We’re going to be helping them a lot. We’re going to be focused, a big focus and including my conversation with both Mitch and with Chuck, a big focus of that conversation with small businesses, because they are really the engine behind our country more so than the big ones. They are the engine behind our country.
--
Donald Trump: (52:49)
I’m not aware of it, I saw some names. I know all of them. I know everyone mentioned Dianne Feinstein, I guess, and a couple of others. I don’t know too much about what it’s about, but I find them to all be very honorable people. That’s all I know. And they said they did nothing wrong. I find them the whole group. Very honorable people. Yeah, please.
--
Donald Trump: (53:24)
Well, it also includes Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat. You didn’t mention her name. What didn’t you mention her name? And I think she’s a very honorable person by the way. So I’m not saying, but you know, it’s interesting that you mentioned two people, but you don’t mention one that happens to be a Democrat.
--
Donald Trump: (53:40)
I don’t know, because I’d have to look at it possibly, but I find them to be honorable people. Yeah.
--
Donald Trump: (53:59)
I do. Because I think Peter is, I’ve dealt with Peter for a long time and I think Peter is a not a good journalist when it comes to fairness.
--
Donald Trump: (54:13)
I think it’s a good message because I think that the country has to understand that there is indeed whether we like it or not, and some of the people in this room won’t like it. There’s a lot of really great news and great journalism and there’s a lot of fake news out there and I hear it all and I see it all and I understand it all because I’m in the midst of it. So when somebody writes a story, or does a story on television, and I know it’s false, I know it’s fake. And when they say they have 15 sources have said, and I know there’s no sources, there’s no sources, they’re just making it up. I know that. And I call Peter out, but I call other people out too. And you know, this is a time to come together, but coming together is much harder when we have dishonest journalists. It’s a very important profession that you’re in. It’s a profession that I think is incredible. I cherish it, but when people are dishonest, they truly do hurt our country. Yeah. In the back. Please, go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (55:37)
Well, I have to say this, we have, and I can speak for myself, but I have a very good relationship with China and with President Xi. I have great respect for President Xi, I consider him to be a friend of mine. It’s unfortunate that this got out of control. It came from China, it got out of control. Some people are upset. I know President Xi, he loves China. He respects the United States and I have to say I respect China greatly and I respect President Xi.
--
Donald Trump: (56:18)
No, I never liked stock buybacks from their standpoint. When we did a big tax cut and when they took the money and did buybacks, that’s not building a hangar. That’s not buying aircraft. That’s not doing the kind of things that I want them to do. And we’re now talking about buybacks. We didn’t think we would have had to restrict it because we thought they would have known better but they didn’t know better. And some cases, not in all cases, obviously some people did an incredible job. They built plants all over the country. I mean you’d see what’s happened.
--
Donald Trump: (56:50)
Until this invisible enemy appeared. I mean we never had an economy like this, but there were some companies that use that money to buy back stock, driving up the price of the stock artificially in many cases. I don’t like that. I don’t like it. And as far as whether or not we’ll have that allow them when we give them money because we have to keep these great companies in business because of the workers. Frankly, for the most part because of the workers, the workers are my number one concern. But the way we take care of the workers is we have to keep the companies going. I am fine with restricting buybacks. In fact, I would demand that there’d be no stock buybacks. I don’t want them taking hundreds of millions of dollars and buying back their stock because that does nothing. Yeah, please.
--
Donald Trump: (57:40)
Sure, and one thing, Secretary of State Pompeo is extremely busy. So if you have any question for him right now, could you do that? Because you know what I’d like to do? I’d like to him to go back to the state department or as they call it, the deep state department. You know, Mike. I’d like to have him go back and do his job. So does anybody have any question? Please.
--
Donald Trump: (58:02)
[crosstalk 00:58:02] Yeah, how about you? Only for the secretary.
--
Donald Trump: (01:00:34)
Just to put it, you know when you said before you said the non Mexicans going to Mexico, we’re not sending them to Mexico, we’re sending them back to their own country. It’s not to Mexico. Why would Mexico take people that aren’t from Mexico? We’re sending them back, in the case of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, lot of other countries, they go back to the country from where they came. Okay. Mike, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:46)
Go ahead, finish up.
--
Donald Trump: (01:03:25)
Maybe we shouldn’t say that.
--
Donald Trump: (01:03:30)
We know plenty.
--
Donald Trump: (01:05:47)
They know the answer, they know the answer. Iran, the leaders. They know the answer to your question.
--
Donald Trump: (01:06:19)
What a good answer. Yes, go ahead. Very true, too.
--
Donald Trump: (01:07:15)
Excuse me, we’ll do that in a second. Let Mike-
--
Donald Trump: (01:09:26)
I’ll rather have, if you could finish up with the Secretary of State-
--
Donald Trump: (01:09:30)
Is everybody finished with the Secretary of State?
--
Donald Trump: (01:10:02)
Well I can just say, the entire world is agreeing with us because, they all have their choice and everybody’s doing the exact same thing. We want to shut it out and we can do that and we’ll see what happens in two weeks and three weeks. But if we can save thousands of lives and even millions of lives potentially, you don’t know where it goes, but you could be talking about millions of lives. So if you look at the the world, I mean you have some very smart people in the world. You have some smart leaders in the world and everybody’s doing it the way we’re doing it. I think we’re doing a better job than hopefully most, if not all, we’re doing a very effective job, but we’ll know better in 14 or 15 days. But you know, you’re talking about hundreds of thousands and maybe more than that numbers of people and you know, we can bring our finances back very quickly. We can’t bring the people back.
--
Donald Trump: (01:11:14)
Yeah, I agree with it, but I think I’d like to have Anthony answer that because to be honest, that’s what he does and we had a lot of very talented people telling us what they think we should do.
--
Donald Trump: (01:12:09)
Secretary of State will be leaving. Any other questions? Go ahead in the back, please. In the back, for Mike. [crosstalk 01:12:17] Excuse me, I didn’t call on you. Go ahead, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:12:54)
[crosstalk 01:12:54] I’m not dealing with him, I’m dealing with the governor and the governor agrees with me and I agree with him. So far we’ve been very much in sync. I guess they’re not agreeing with each other necessarily, but the relationship with New York, I love New York. I grew up in New York as you probably have heard and the relationship’s been very good and I think government and the governor have been getting along incredibly well with the federal government. Okay.
--
Donald Trump: (01:14:14)
Anybody?
--
Donald Trump: (01:14:28)
Well, I believe in a lot of things. I want to get workers money and whichever way, the best way to get it, and I want to keep the businesses open too, because without the businesses, they’re not going to be getting money for very long. [crosstalk 01:14:42]. If there’s not, we’ll do something later I’m sure.
--
Donald Trump: (01:15:04)
We’re not talking about $1,000 check. We’re talking about much more than that. We’re also talking about doing phases. If this doesn’t work, we’re going to keep doing until we get it going and frankly, once we get the economy back and once this enemy is defeated, the invisible enemy as I call it, once it’s defeated, we get the economy back, it’s going to all come back to us very quickly. It comes back very quickly. We have a tremendous economy. We do numbers like no other country has ever done before.
--
Donald Trump: (01:15:32)
Number one in the world, if you go back two weeks and still obviously, but if you go back two weeks, number one in the world by far. That money comes back to us very rapidly. We want to keep it. We want to have it so that when we are, not if, but when we win the war with the invisible enemy, when we win it, these companies can immediately start. Not that they have to start rebuilding, which takes a long time. Steve. [inaudible 01:15:57] Steve. I’m confident. I’m confident.
--
Donald Trump: (01:16:03)
We’re looking at different numbers. We have a best case and a not best case but the big thing is to defeat the virus. Once that virus is defeated, Steve, I think everything else falls in place very rapidly. I think you’re going to have a tremendous upswing. A lot of people agree with me. If you look at your stock market geniuses and some of whom are not geniuses, but they think they are, a lot of people think that I’m right about that, that once we defeat the virus, I think you’re going to have a very steep, like a rocket ship. It’s going to go up and everything will be back and I really believe we’re going to be stronger than ever before. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:16:51)
You heard my news conference yesterday. [crosstalk 01:16:55] yesterday’s news. No, that does happen because they want to buy supplies. We want to buy as a backup to them in case they can’t and sometimes that will happen, but regardless of who gets them when they need them, we’re getting them to them. Now we’re doing the Production Act, we’re doing it very much and we have a lot of things cooking right now at a high level.
--
Donald Trump: (01:17:14)
Remember this, nothing like this has ever happened before. Over 140 countries and you have supply chains that are broken down for two reasons because they can’t supply that much and because people are sick and they can’t be on the chain. So you have a lot of interesting things all over the world. You have supply chains that broke down because of the illness and also because of the fact that the quantity. But we’re getting it ordered, we’re getting it done and you just have to look. Some of you were at the call yesterday where I spoke with the governors, almost all of the governors, and every one of them was very impressed with what we’ve done. Go ahead. In the middle. [inaudible 01:17:55]
--
Donald Trump: (01:18:00)
I would have to talk to them. I would have to talk to them.
--
Donald Trump: (01:18:12)
So far we haven’t had to. It’s an amazing thing that happened. We’re getting calls from automobile companies. We’re getting calls from other companies saying they have plant capacity. They want to make ventilators. They want to make other things. We are literally being besieged in a beautiful way by companies that want to do the work. They want to do the job. They want to help us. They want to help our country, so we haven’t had a problem with that at all.
--
Donald Trump: (01:18:46)
Well when they call us they let us know. If there’s a conflict they will call us and we will drop our bid because we want them to go first because their point, at point of sale. So we’ve had four or five instances where literally that was happening because you know we’re both trying to get stock and if we’re going against, they will call us, the smart ones frankly, will call us and we will immediately, we want them to buy it because it gets to them quicker if they buy it.
--
Donald Trump: (01:19:16)
They know that and it’s happening more and more where they’re calling and they’re saying, we’re bidding against each other. They want to get it. They’ll get it much quicker that way. [crosstalk 01:19:27] Go ahead, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:19:41)
Well, it’s going very well. I tell you what.
--
Donald Trump: (01:19:42)
We inherited an obsolete deal and we’ve made a good thing out of it. I haven’t heard that question in awhile, but go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:24:23)
When we need something because of the act. When we need something, we order something and as you know, two days ago I invoked the act, which was a big step. I’m not sure that it had been done before, certainly not very much and when we need something, we will use the act. What has happened is before we even go out, many, many companies, great companies, companies in a totally different business are willing to do things and make things because that’s what they do, they make product. They’re willing to make product for us, medical product that we need very badly for the States that the States can’t get, they haven’t been able to get. And you know most of the States in no way did they do anything wrong. They were stocked up, they were all equipped. Unfortunately they’ve never had a thing like this. So they need help from the federal government. [crosstalk 01:25:09]
--
Donald Trump: (01:25:17)
I have. I have, yes.
--
Donald Trump: (01:25:17)
A lot. A lot. And they’re making it a lot of ventilators and they make it a lot of masks. Go ahead, please. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:25:33)
I can’t say they are, but they will be very shortly because we’re working with one in particular, the ones to make ventilators. They called us yesterday and they’re already, we’re working on a transaction. They’re going to make ventilators. They say they’ve done it before, which surprised me, but they can do it very easily. [crosstalk 01:25:53]
--
Donald Trump: (01:26:07)
No, not donate. That’s not the word, donate. He’s not giving them. He’s going to let me use them. I spoke with Micky Arison who is the president, chairman, CEO and owner. [crosstalk 01:26:19] He said to me that he was willing to, if we need ships, if we need ships for helping people, that Carnival would be absolutely willing to help us in Los Angeles, in New York, wherever they may be in Miami where they’re very big. If we needed something, they would be willing to. So far we haven’t needed to. And we’re bringing the big hospital ships up in California. We haven’t, we’re working with the governor of California as you know, with Gavin and we haven’t made a determination. We’re also talking to folks who would like it in Seattle, so where we’re discussing where it can be most useful. We’ve spoken with governor Cuomo and we’re bringing the big hospital ship up in two weeks and we’re going to have it in New York Harbor someplace in New York Harbor.
--
Donald Trump: (01:27:07)
No, I haven’t taken them up on it yet. I said, if we need it, I’ll let you know. That’s called taking them up.
--
Donald Trump: (01:27:10)
Right now, we don’t need it.
--
Donald Trump: (01:27:24)
What I can tell you, they’re very clean and also those surfaces, the germ, as you know, the virus disappears over a period of time and these ships are very clean. They’ve been kept very clean, they’d been gone over. But the virus, as you know, if it’s on a surface for a certain, they have actually charts different kinds of surfaces, it disappears over a period of time.
--
Donald Trump: (01:27:47)
What are you trying to get at? Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:27:50)
It disappears. The virus disappears when it’s on surface after a certain number of days or in some cases, hours depending on the surface.
--
Donald Trump: (01:28:09)
I will be, but first I want to get the approval from the company because I don’t want to be doing that. I assume they’d like it, but I’ll let you know.
--
Donald Trump: (01:28:19)
One company that has openly stated it is General Motors, one of the companies, [crosstalk 01:28:25] but I didn’t speak to them about announcing it, but I’ll announce it. I’m sure they wouldn’t be. But we have others also.
--
Donald Trump: (01:29:49)
We’re hearing very positive things about testing and just so you understand, we don’t want every American to go out and get a test. 350 million people. We don’t want that. We want people that have a problem, that have a problem with they’re sneezing they’re sniffling, they don’t feel good, they have a temperature. There are a lot of different things. You know them better than I do. So ready. We don’t need that. But what we are having is we’re having these private labs have come in, they’ve been really fantastic and we also have a great system for the future because as I said, we inherited, we meaning this administration an obsolete broken system that wasn’t meant for anything like this. Now we have a system that you can see because look, we’re well into this and nobody’s even talking about it, except for you, which doesn’t surprise me.
--
Donald Trump: (01:30:40)
Well, okay, I’m not hearing it.
--
Donald Trump: (01:30:45)
But we don’t want everybody to go out and get a test because there’s no reason for it. Yeah, we’ll do one more after this.
--
Donald Trump: (01:32:05)
But I do think, and that’s after listening to Tony and everybody else that’s an expert. I do think it’s important that not everybody be tested. If you feel great and if you have no symptoms whatsoever, it’s just not a good thing to be doing. Steve.
--
Donald Trump: (01:34:33)
Want to finish up? Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:36:43)
Just so you know, just for the probably a hundredth time, I, this administration, inherited an obsolete broken old system that wasn’t meant for this. We discarded that system and we now have a new system that can do millions of people as you need them, but we had to get rid of a broken old system that didn’t work. It worked only on a very limited basis and we’re very proud of what we’ve done. It’s incredible what we’ve done and this system will now serve for the future, for future problems.
--
Donald Trump: (01:37:21)
Hopefully you don’t have a problem like this, but something will come up. We have now a great system and it’s almost fully in gear, but it’s able to test millions of people. But we inherited a broken old, frankly, a terrible system. We fixed it and we’ve done a great job and we haven’t been given the credit that we deserve, that I can tell you. The one that really deserves the credit are the American people because they are doing things that nobody thought they would do. What they’re doing is incredible and we’re making a lot of progress and we’ll see you folks tomorrow. Thank you very much. [crosstalk 01:38:04]
Donald Trump: (00:00)
Well, thank you very much, and I see we have fewer people because of the virus problem, and we appreciate you being here. This is getting to be more and more social distancing and that’s fine, that’s the way it should be, and it’s too bad. We extend our best wishes to the person affected and we feel sure that he or she will be better very soon.
--
Donald Trump: (00:42)
Thank you for being here. America continues to mobilize every segment of our society to turn the tide in the battle against the virus. I want Americans to know that we will get through this challenge, the hardship will end, it will end soon, normal life will return and our economy will rebound very, very strongly, but right now in the midst of this great national trial, Americans must remain united in purpose and focused on victory. To every single American, please know that the sacrifice you’re making at this time is saving lives many, many lives.
--
Donald Trump: (01:23)
It’s very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States and all around the world. They’re amazing people and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape or form. They’re working closely with us to get rid of it. We will prevail together. It’s very important. From the beginning, we have been working closely with our nation’s best scientists and medical professionals and we will continue to do so until we have defeated the virus. Our public health experts, who are terrific, are studying the variation in the disease across the country and we will be using data to recommend new protocols to allow local economies to cautiously resume their activity at the appropriate time. We also have a large team working on what the next steps will be once the medical community gives a region the okay, meaning the okay to get going, to get back “Let’s go to work.”
--
Donald Trump: (02:25)
Our country wasn’t built to be shut down. This is not a country that was built for this. It was not built to be shut down. My administration continues to work with Democrats and Republicans to reach an agreement on an urgent relief bill for the millions of American workers, and small businesses and large businesses that were badly affected by the medical difficulty that we’ve had. If you had a viable business in January, we are committed to ensuring the same is true in the coming weeks. In fact, we want to make it even better than it was before and we’re doing things to help in that regard. America will again, and soon be open for business. Very soon. A lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting. A lot sooner.
--
Donald Trump: (03:18)
We can not let the cure be worse than the problem itself. We’re not going to let the cure be worse than the problem. At the end of the 15 day period we’ll make a decision as to which way we want to go, where we want to go, the timing, and essentially we’re referring to the timing of the opening, essentially the opening of our country, because we have it pretty well shut down in order to get rid of this invisible enemy.
--
Donald Trump: (03:46)
Two weeks ago we moved at record speed to pass paid sick leave and paid family medical leave, and approved $8 billion including money for the development of treatments and vaccines, and we’re doing tremendous work in both, on both fronts. The vaccines are coming along very quickly. Now, Congress must demonstrate the same bipartisanship again and join together to pass the Senate bill as written and avoid playing anymore partisan games. They have to get together and just stop with the partisan politics, and I think that’s happening. I got a call a little while ago, I guess they’re getting closer. It should go quickly, and it must go quickly. It’s not really choice. They don’t have a choice, they have to make a deal. This should not be a time for political agendas, but rather one for focusing solely and squarely on the needs of the American people. We are going to save American workers and we’re going to save them quickly, and we’re going to save our great American companies, both small and large. This was a medical problem, we are not going to let it turn into a long lasting financial problem.
--
Donald Trump: (05:01)
It started out as a purely medical problem and it’s not going to go beyond that. We’re just not going to allow that to happen. Our country was at its strongest financial point, we’ve never had an economy like we had just a few weeks ago, and then it got a hit with something that nobody could have ever thought possible, and we are fixing it. We’re fixing it quickly, and I want to just thank the American people for what they’ve been through and what they’re doing. Our country will be stronger than ever before and we fully anticipate that, and it won’t be that long.
--
Donald Trump: (05:39)
Let me provide you with an update on critical supplies. FEMA is distributing 8,000,095 respirator masks and 13.3 million surgical masks across the country right now, focusing on the areas with the greatest need. We have shipped 73 pallets of personal protective equipment to New York City and 36 pallets to the state of Washington. In the past 96 hours, FEMA has also received donations of approximately 6.5 million masks. We’re having millions and millions of masks made as we speak, and other personal protective equipment which we will be distributing to medical hotspots. We’re focused on some of the hotspots across the nation. We’re seeing an outpouring of creativity and innovative ideas widely shared between the federal health leaders, governors and mayors, the scientific community and members of the private sector really working together. Everybody’s working together.
--
Donald Trump: (06:41)
I’m pleased to report that clinical trials in New York will begin existing for existing drugs that may prove effective against the virus. At my direction, the federal government is working to help obtain large quantities of flororoquin, and you can look from any standpoint tomorrow in New York, we think tomorrow pretty early. The hydroxychloroquine and the Z-Pak, I think as a combination probably is looking very, very good and it’s going to be distributed. We have 10,000 units going, and it’ll be distributed tomorrow. It’ll be available, and it is now. They already have it. They’re going to distribute it tomorrow morning to a lot of people in New York City and New York. We’re studying it very closely, watching it very closely. You probably saw a couple of articles today came out where a gentleman, they thought he was not going to make it, he said goodbye to his family, they had given him the drug just a little while before, but he thought it was over. His family thought he was going to die, and a number of hours later he woke up, felt good. Then he woke up again and he felt really good, and he’s in good shape, and he’s very happy for this particular drug that we got approved in record setting time.
--
Donald Trump: (08:16)
There’s never been anything even close to it, and I want to thank the FDA, which has been incredible, and Dr. Hahn, Stephen Hahn, a highly respected man, but they’re doing everything possible to increase production and available supply of these drugs, not only this drug but also others that are coming. Remdesivir is coming from Regeneron, a couple of others are also under study, but the one that I’m very excited about right now is the one we just mentioned, and I think there’s a real chance, I mean, again, we don’t know, but there’s a real chance that it could have a tremendous impact. It would be a gift from God if that worked. It would be a big game changer, so we’ll see, but distribution starts tomorrow morning early in New York and I think a lot of people are going to be, hopefully they’re going to be very happy with the result, but we’re all going to be watching closely. It’s something we have to try. It’s been very, very successful on Malaria, very, very successful, and countries with Malaria have had an interesting thing happen. They take this particular drug, it’s a very powerful drug, and there is very little semblance of the virus in those countries, and there are those that say because this drug is very prevalent because of the Malaria, so we’ll see what happens.
--
Donald Trump: (09:44)
I’m also announcing that we’re postponing the deadline for compliance with real ID requirements at a time when we’re asking Americans to maintain social distancing. We do want to require people to go with their local DMV. We will be announcing the new deadline very soon. It’s going to be announced in a very short moment.
--
Donald Trump: (10:11)
Over night, we successfully brought home 103 American citizens after they had been stranded for 10 days in Brazil following a cruise. We want to thank the Brazilian government and their great president. Most of those returned were senior citizens. My administration, in cooperation with Governor Greg Abbott of Texas and the private sector coordinated their safe return to the United States, so thank you to Governor Abbott, a terrific governor, terrific man.
--
Donald Trump: (10:41)
Earlier today I signed an executive order invoking presidential authority under Section 45-12 of the Defense Production act to prohibit the hoarding of vital medical equipment and supplies such as hand sanitizers, face masks and personal protective equipment. We have a lot of face masks, a lot of equipment just coming in, and we have some people hoarding, and Attorney General Barr’s going to be speaking about that in a second. We want to prevent price gouging and critical health and medical resources are going to be protected in every form. Under this directive the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to designate essential health and medical supplies as scarce, so he’ll designate certain supplies and medical elements as scarce, and that means it will be a crime to stockpile these items in excessive quantities, which is happening to a relatively small degree we think, but nevertheless, it’s happening. We can’t let it happen, and we can’t let them resell them at excessive prices, which some people are doing. Very simply, will not allow anyone to exploit the suffering of American citizens for their own profit, so we’re going to be watching that with our great Attorney General very closely.
--
Donald Trump: (12:05)
The Department of Justice will be aggressively prosecuting fraudulent schemes related to the pandemic. Yesterday, federal prosecutors took action in their first case, shutting down a website selling a totally fake vaccine, if you can believe that one. As president, I will always fight to protect Americans from being exploited. Thankfully, all throughout the country we’re witnessing extraordinary acts of compassion, benevolence and unity. Construction companies are donating masks by the hundreds of thousands, manufacturing workers are transforming their assembly lines, citizens are volunteering to deliver food and medicine to the elderly, we’re truly seeing America at its best. We’re really seeing things that people never thought even could happen. Frankly, we never thought this could happen, but the way most Americans are working toward getting it solved and just doing what they have to do to make this go away has been incredible. It’s been incredible.
--
Donald Trump: (13:12)
I want to take a moment to thank the everyday heroes who are making our vast effort against the virus possible, and thank you to the healthcare workers and the first responders. These are very brave people. Thanks also to the hardworking men and women of Federal Express, UPS, the United States Postal Service, and the truckers who are maintaining our supply chains and supply lines. We thank you very much. Great job. We also want to give our regards and thanks to everyone at our grocery stores working the night shift so that shelves can be restocked, and the restaurant workers and delivery drivers keeping our families fed. So many of these restaurants, it’s incredible. They’re doing a service where people come and they pick it up, delivery. It’s been incredible what they’ve been doing. A totally different business than they were in, other than they cook food. Other than that, it’s like a totally different business.
--
Donald Trump: (14:13)
Most of all, I want to thank the American people for rising to the challenge and showing incredible courage, determination, patience, grace and grit. From New York to Seattle and everywhere in between, your acts of selflessness, and sacrifice and ingenuity are a powerful testament to the American character. It’s really being shown. It’s really showing up at a level that people are really respecting. All over the world, they’re respecting, and the world has problems. We’re 148 countries now. 148 countries are affected by the invisible scourge, and all of the uplifting reflections of the American spirit are out there for everyone to see. Together, we will care for our fellow citizens and we will win this war, and we’ll win it much sooner than people think and we’ll be back in business as a country pretty soon. You’ll be hearing about that also pretty soon.
--
Donald Trump: (15:17)
Now, I’d like to ask Attorney General Bill Barr to say a few words, and we’ll take questions in a little while. Thank you.
--
Donald Trump: (19:53)
Thank you very much, [inaudible 00:19:55].
--
Donald Trump: (19:53)
Deborah? Deborah, please.
--
Donald Trump: (24:03)
Thank you very much, Deborah. [inaudible 00:24:07].
--
Donald Trump: (32:55)
Thank you, Mike.
--
Donald Trump: (35:03)
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
--
Donald Trump: (35:20)
Of course I do. It’s going to be bad and we have a lot of people dying from the flu. As you know, we have a very bad flu season on top of everything else. It’s very bad. It looks like it could be over 50,000, and certainly this is going to be bad. We’re trying to make it so that it’s much, much less bad and that’s what we’re doing. I think we’re doing a very good job of it.
--
Donald Trump: (35:44)
If you look at other countries, what they’ve been through, and you look at the kind of numbers and compare them to ours, which is a much larger country than most, the numbers are pretty amazing. And it started with the fact that we stopped people from coming in from a highly infected area and that was a good thing to do. So yeah, it’s bad and obviously the numbers are going to increase with time, and then they’re going to start to decrease.
--
Donald Trump: (36:12)
And we’re going to be opening our country up for business because our country was meant to be open and working with others but especially for our workers. And the engine for that whole system is we have to have companies and these companies are loved by our workers because they’re paying big salaries and big dollars to our workers. And we’re going to get it all going again very soon, hopefully very, very soon.
--
Donald Trump: (36:43)
Please.
--
Donald Trump: (37:12)
Well, you’ll see what happens. I understand the question very well. It’s a great question, but we can do two things at one time. I will say this, our country’s learned a lot. We’ve learned about social distancing. We’ve learned about the hands, we’ve learned about staying away at least during the time that this is even a little bit around this disease or whatever you want to call it. Many different names, you can go up many different names, but the virus while it’s around.
--
Donald Trump: (37:43)
And we can start thinking about, as an example, parts of our country are very lightly effected, very small numbers. You look at a state, great governor, Pete Ricketts in Nebraska. You look at the kind of numbers they have out there. They have one of the great hospitals there too, relative to what we’re talking about. But you look at Nebraska, you look at Idaho, you look at Iowa. I could name many countries that are handling it very, very well and that are not affected to the same extent or frankly not even nearly to the extent of New York. I’m dealing with the Governor Cuomo and we’re dealing very well together. We’ll be sending that ship up, by the way, as you know. We have a ship going to Los Angeles. The ship is coming out of a very large repair, so ready to go or very soon will be. And over the next three or four weeks that’ll be coming up to New York. We’ll go to New York Harbor and it’ll be fully supplied, so they’re working on that right now.
--
Donald Trump: (39:04)
Well, I didn’t say a week, but I said soon. It’s going to be a soon. It’s not going to be three or four months as some people were saying and a lot of people thought originally, but I would certainly let you answer.
--
Donald Trump: (42:07)
I think that’s a great definition, and I will say we’re going to be watching our senior citizens very closely. We’re going to be watching certain hotspots like New York, and within New York you have areas which are troubling and we’ll be working with the governor and the mayor and everybody else on those spots.
--
Donald Trump: (42:25)
But at the same time, at a certain point, we have to get open and we have to get moving. We don’t want to lose these companies. We don’t want to lose these workers. We want to take care of our workers, so we’ll be doing something I think relatively quickly, but we’ve learned a lot during this period. This was a very necessary period. Tremendous information was gained, but we can do two things at one time.
--
Donald Trump: (42:50)
And again, I say, we have a very active flu season, more active than most. It’s looking like it’s heading to 50,000 or more deaths, deaths not cases. 50,000 deaths, that’s a lot. And you look at automobile accidents, which are far greater than any numbers we’re talking about. That doesn’t mean we’re going to tell everybody no more driving of cars. We have to do things to get our country open. But this has been an incredible period of learning and we’ll have announcements over the next fairly short period as to the timing. John, please.
--
Donald Trump: (43:56)
Yeah. I’ll let you answer him.
--
Donald Trump: (45:43)
Uh-oh.
--
Donald Trump: (46:02)
Whew. Thank you for saying that. Thank you very much.
--
Donald Trump: (46:37)
Well, they will be in place. At some point, we’re going to open up our country and it’s going to be fairly soon.
--
Donald Trump: (46:46)
I’m not looking at months, I can tell you right now. We’re going to be opening up our country and we’re going to be watching certain areas and we’re going to be practicing everything that Deborah is referring to right here. I mean, we’re going to be watching this very closely, but you can’t keep it closed for years, okay.
--
Donald Trump: (47:06)
This is going away. We’re going to win the battle, but you have tremendous responsibility. We have jobs. We have people get tremendous anxiety and depression and you have suicides over things like this. When you have terrible economies, you have death probably, and I mean definitely would be in far greater numbers than the numbers that we’re talking about with regard to the virus. We have an obligation. We have a double obligation.
--
Donald Trump: (47:38)
We have a great country. There is no country like it in the world and there’s no economy like it in the world. I mean, we were just blazing. We were coming out with numbers that some numbers weren’t even reported because this had happened. They were meaningless. I got numbers about myself that were meaningless. Because by the time the numbers came in, it’s a whole different world with this.
--
Donald Trump: (47:58)
But I will tell you that we can do both things, John. We can do them both at the same time. I mean, that’s okay. What we have gone through is a tremendous learning process and we’ve also solved a lot of problems. But we’ve gone through a tremendous learning situation. Now, we’re building hospitals in New York. We’re building hospitals in California. We’re building hospitals in the state of Washington. We’ve been in touch with the governors. Today I spoke with a man that I happened to like. I spoke with Phil in New Jersey and where we’re going to be doing something very meaningful in New Jersey. We’re doing something… I spoke with, JB Pritzker called me today. We’re going to be helping them out in Illinois. We’re doing a lot of things in Florida.
--
Donald Trump: (48:46)
We’re doing a lot of things between FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Admiral in your group in terms of the purchasing, that’s what he does. He purchases. He supposed to be great. I’ll tell you in about two days, but he’s going to do a fantastic job. We have an incredibly talented group of people. But yeah, we’ll be doing two things and three things at one time.
--
Donald Trump: (49:11)
Well, at the same time though, we’re going to be watching very closely the hotspots. We’re going to be taking care and watching very closely our senior citizens, especially those with a problem or an illness. We’re going to be watching them very, very closely; and we can do that and have an open economy, have an open country. And we have to do that because that causes other problems and maybe it causes much bigger problems than the problem we’re talking about now. You understand. Jeff, please.
--
Donald Trump: (49:45)
I think the cure has been very tough. This has been very tough. This was an operation. This was somebody going to a doctor and saying, “You need an operation,” and we’ve had an operation. We’ve learned a lot and we fixed a lot of problems. One of the things we fixed is if you look at the absolute system that this administration inherited, it wasn’t meant for this. It was meant for a small group of people; and even for that, it was not very good and very obsolete.
--
Donald Trump: (50:14)
We have a testing program now that will hopefully be able to be used for many years into the future should we have another event like this. I don’t think you’ll have another event like this. This is very unique. You look back into time, you look back decades and decades. We can name them all. Even if you go back 10 years, you know you go back to ’09, but that wasn’t like this as it turned out. But they lost a lot of people. We were early. We were early,, Jeff because of the fact that we closed early. That was a big move. Please, [Kristin 00:50:47]. Yeah, go ahead, Jim.
--
Donald Trump: (51:04)
Well, it’s not change. No, we’re doing things… Yeah. This was a learning experience for the people of the country.
--
Donald Trump: (51:12)
If what’s changed?
--
Donald Trump: (51:17)
Well, I think we’ve learned a lot. I think that there’s so much discipline now that we never had. Nobody ever said don’t shake hands. I did actually before I became a politician. Once I became a politician then it’s hard getting used to not doing it because you do it with everybody. With literally thousands of people a week, you’re shaking hands with big groups of people.
--
Donald Trump: (51:43)
We’ve learned a lot. There’s a great discipline that this whole country has learned having to do with distancing, having to do with shaking hands. I think a lot of it’s going to stay long after the viruses go and I really think it’s probably good practice anyway, but I think it’s going to stay long after the virus has gone.
--
Donald Trump: (51:59)
We have to open our country because that causes problems that, in my opinion, could be far bigger problems, far bigger. Look, this is a severe medical situation that could cause problems far beyond the medical, and then increase the medical problems to things that had nothing to do with this original medical problem. We can’t let that happen to our country. We have the greatest country in the world. I’m not going to let that happen, but this two weeks that we have spent, has been an incredible learning period and process. Please, Kristin.
--
Donald Trump: (52:45)
I spoke to them today and I was telling them that we have two things to look forward. Don’t forget the doctors, if it were up to the doctors, they may say let’s keep it shut down. Let’s shut down the entire world. Because, again, you’re up to almost 150 countries, so let’s shut down the entire world. And when we shut it down, that would be wonderful and let’s keep it shut for a couple of years. You know you can’t do that and you can’t do that with a country, especially the number one economy anywhere in the world by far. Number one economy in the world, you can’t do that.

Donald Trump: (53:15)
Well, it causes bigger problems than the original. That’s why I talk about the cure being worse than the problem. We can’t have the cure be worse than the problem. But what we have done… So this is not retracing, this isn’t anything. We’ve done it really well because this two-week period has been good and I’m not saying it ends at that time. We have another seven days or so. I’m not saying it ends at that time, but I am saying it’s been this incredible learning process. That’s going to go into the future. That’s going to go even as we open up our country. And we’re going to be watching New York and we’re going to be watching California, we’re going to be watching the state of Washington and other places. Illinois is becoming a hotspot, and we can do both.
--
Donald Trump: (54:02)
Now, we may quarantine… I mean we will be quarantining many people in these areas. There are other areas that just aren’t affected or they’re affected very little. And why would we close down 100% of the country? There are areas within New York where New York will be open, but there are areas within New York. Remember this, New York has the New York Stock Exchange. It has NASDAQ, it has the exchanges. To close the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ with all of the great work they’re doing. I mean, they’ve gone largely to computer. You look at the floor, it’s incredible what they can do, but it’s fully open. But we don’t want to be doing that.
--
Donald Trump: (54:45)
What I’m saying basically is that we can do two things simultaneously, and we’ve had this incredible learning period. Plus, people have been in a period and they won’t be calling, “Oh gee.” Because I’ve got many, many people that now come to me and say, “We get it. We think we can really do it now and do it while we’re open.” So at some point, we’ll be setting some guidelines, we’ll be setting some datelines and we’ll be announcing them in the not too distant future.
--
Donald Trump: (55:15)
Well, not endorsed. We talked together, and I think they’re okay with it and I’m okay with it, but this could be a much bigger problem. This could create a much bigger problem than the problem that you start off with. Now other nations are going to have to do what they’re going to do, but they’ll probably do something very similar.
--
Donald Trump: (55:33)
But in our case, much more so than anyone else, because of the magnitude of our economy, the tremendous size of what we’ve built and what we have and the jobs involved. You have almost 160 million jobs in this country now, the most ever by far, by far the most ever. The number of jobs, almost 160 million, so we can’t turn that off and think it’s going to be wonderful. They’ll be tremendous repercussions. There will be a tremendous death from that, death. You’re talking about death.
--
Donald Trump: (56:03)
Death from the death, you’re talking about death. Probably more death from that than anything that we’re talking about with respect to the virus.
--
Donald Trump: (56:15)
No, I think we’re going to do them both. I think that’s what I’m saying. I think we can do them both now. Now, we haven’t announced a date, but we’re getting fairly close to coming up with a date and it’s a much shorter period of time than I’ve been hearing the news report. And I think everybody should be happy with that, but great knowledge was gained. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (56:46)
You mean with the Democrats you’re talking about?
--
Donald Trump: (56:58)
Well, it is true. If he said… I didn’t hear him say that, but if he said, “Difficult trade-offs,” sure. It’s less convenient. Before you walk and you’d hop in the subway and you had grab the handle and you go down to wherever you’re going on Wall Street and you do all sorts of things and you go in and you open the doors going into your great buildings or into the exchanges and now you’re not going to have to… Maybe you think about doing that or you’re going to think about doing it a different way.
--
Donald Trump: (57:23)
No, no. There are many trade-offs. It’s a different life and maybe it will remain that way frankly after the invisible scourge is gone. Maybe it’s going to say that way. Not a bad thing to stay that way, but no, there are trade-offs. There’s no question about that, but I actually think it’s going to… I think in the end we’re going to end up being bigger, better and stronger. We have learned a lot. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (57:50)
That’s true. Latin America.
--
Donald Trump: (57:56)
No, we’re not really. Something like that could happen, I guess, but we’re not really. They thought we were going to have bans within the United States. We didn’t do that. We’re not going to have that. Hopefully that’ll take care of itself. No ones, in Latin America, there is a, there’s been an uptick. Yeah, please.
--
Donald Trump: (58:26)
Yeah, because it seems that there could be a little bit of nasty language toward the Asian Americans in our country and I don’t like that at all. These are incredible people. They love our country and I’m not going to let it happen. I just wanted to make that point.
--
Donald Trump: (58:41)
Because they’re blaming China-
--
Donald Trump: (58:43)
People are blaming China. And they are making statements to great American citizens that happened to be of Asian heritage and I’m not going to let that happen. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (59:05)
Yeah, the governors of the various states will have a lot of leeway. If we open up, and when we open up, the governors in certain states. For instance, you go to some of the states I just mentioned, those schools are going to be open. Many cases, they’re open now, but the schools are going to be open. In other cases, Governor Cuomo, Gavin Newsom, of California, certain governors are going to maybe have a decision to make. Now, they may make a decision to keep them open in a certain part of New York and maybe in Westchester County or wherever it may be, they’ll keep them closed.
--
Donald Trump: (59:40)
But they’re going to have leeway. We giving the governors a lot of leeway.
--
Donald Trump: (59:50)
The governors are going to make those decisions. That’s going to be up to the governors and they’re very capable. They’ll be able to make the decisions. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:00:05)
Because the virus has had a big impact on our country, so we’re going to give a stimulus so that the workers can live their life. It was not their fault, it wasn’t the workers’ fault. And we are going to give a kick, so that it’s a kick. And this way we think the workers can get a fair start. The small businesses, we’re taking very good care of, we want to take care of these small businesses. They really are the engine of this country. A lot of people don’t know that. Everyone thinks of these great, big, beautiful businesses, who by the way have been very badly hurt also.
--
Donald Trump: (01:00:41)
But the small businesses have really, historically been the engine and they still are the engine of the country. And you’d be amazed. The workers love those businesses and the workers contact us and they want us to help those businesses because that’s where they’ve made their living.
--
Donald Trump: (01:00:59)
That’s where they’ve been paid a lot of money over the years. And you’ve been seeing what’s happened over the last three years, where salaries and wages have gone up very substantially for those workers. And then, we got caught by this sudden craziness coming into our country and coming all over the world. We need to make sure that the companies are strong and that the workers are strong and that’s what we’re doing. And hopefully, the Republicans and Democrats are going to be able to make a deal and they’re actually fairly close. But we’ll see what happens. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:01:35)
Well, one of the things you’re going to have to save companies that have been shattered. You’re going to have to save a various, I mean, you know a lot of the companies yourselves, we have a company that was I think the greatest company in the world named Boeing. Boeing is going to need some help. Now, Boeing had some difficulty before. That’s unlike others. We have other companies that didn’t have a problem coming in. Boeing had the obvious problem that everybody knows about from a little more than a year ago, a double problem, and it was a big one.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:08)
And then on top of it, as they’re getting ready to really show their stuff on top of it, we all get hit by this and obviously the airlines are going to have a problem, but the airlines aren’t going to be buying from Boeing or from anybody else right now because of this difficulty. We have to work with the airlines, we have to work with the cruise lines. We have to work with the companies like a Boeing because Boeing’s a potentially, again, a great company. Had a very rough period of 13 months, a very rough period, a horrible period. An unbelievable period.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:41)
If you would’ve told me this would have happened to Boeing, I wouldn’t have believed it. Because to me it was truly one of the great, one of the truly great, probably almost one point of GDP if you can think of that’s hard to believe, that a company could have that kind of an impact. But Boeing, we have to work with it for two reasons.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:59)
Number one, it’s a great company that we have to save. Number two, it produces unbelievable numbers of jobs. And so, the numbers have to be reflective of that kind of a thing. Please. You know what I’m going to do? We have wonderful people behind us that are working very hard and we want Bill to get back to the Department of Justice, so we want the admiral to start going and doing your job. And the same thing with Deb. If anybody would have any questions, maybe I’ll ask Mike to stay around, but if anybody would have any questions for the group and otherwise I’ll let them get back to work. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:05:54)
Go ahead, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:08:51)
We have some, it should be fairly quick.
--
Donald Trump: (01:08:59)
I have a question for you. We have a lot of very angry media all around this room and they want one of these seats, but because of social distancing, we are keeping them empty and they are keeping them empty. Will there ever be a time when all of those really angry, angry people who don’t like me much to start off with, but now they really don’t like me, will there ever be a time when these seats are full, like full to the brim like it used to be where people are almost sitting on each other’s lap?
--
Donald Trump: (01:09:32)
And this whole row over here is packed and now they’re outside wanting to get in and they’re very jealous of all of these reporters. Will we ever have that again? Or is that something that will be, you know, it’ll look like this forever?
--
Donald Trump: (01:09:50)
Right?
--
Donald Trump: (01:10:28)
But when the virus is gone, will the people be allowed to sit next to each other again, in your opinion in a tight room with a tight?
--
Donald Trump: (01:12:53)
Yup, you’re doing it.
--
Donald Trump: (01:13:32)
And I think the big factor is the mortality rate, we’re talking about about the mortality rate. When we first started, people were thinking about three and 4% and now we’re talking about a much lower number than that. I think it’s a-
--
Donald Trump: (01:13:44)
I think it’s a number that will be a lot different than people thought.
--
Donald Trump: (01:14:28)
[crosstalk 00:18:29]. It’s much lower than we originally thought. I mean, frankly-
--
Donald Trump: (01:14:34)
It’s a lot lower.
--
Donald Trump: (01:15:50)
Doctor, it’s just very interesting. The whole thing. It’s an incredible subject. When somebody is very sick, they go to a doctor, go to a hospital, they’re recorded, they’re very sick, and then they live or they don’t live, see what happens. But when somebody isn’t very sick at all, I’ve heard people that they don’t even know they had it and they’re healing. Then I’ve heard people that have like a cold or they have a running nose or even people that stay home and they think they have the flu, or in some cases they think they have a really bad case of the flu.
--
Donald Trump: (01:16:19)
But all of those people, that vast majority of, I mean beyond vast majority of people, they’re not reporting. They’re not calling the doctor, they’re not calling them.
--
Donald Trump: (01:16:28)
They’re just getting better. You would think it would have to be because the people that are sick are going to a doctor or they’re going someplace, and they’re going to say, “Make me better.” The people that are just short of that and people that aren’t even, I mean, we have many people where they literally don’t even know that they have it. Now, you’re building up the number of cases that we talked about before and yet, so you don’t know any what, you don’t know how many they are. [crosstalk 01:16:55]. It could be a vast number. But what you do know is all the people that are really sick.
--
Donald Trump: (01:16:59)
Because all of the people that are really sick are going to a doctor in some form. And the doctor is reporting it in all cases itself.
--
Donald Trump: (01:17:24)
I’m talking about many forms.
--
Donald Trump: (01:17:29)
We’re talking about… Look, number one, it’s the country itself. You’re talking tremendous disruption economically, but you’re talking about massive depression, massive numbers of suicide-
--
Donald Trump: (01:17:42)
No, I’m talking about, no, I’m not talking about economic. Although, you could be talking about that, too.
--
Donald Trump: (01:17:48)
What I’m talking about is people suffering massive depression because they had a fantastic job and now they have no idea what’s going on. Now, here’s the good news. If they get the bill passed, we’re taking care of those people. We’re going to really take good care of those people beyond what any country has done for people. But there’s never been anything like this.
--
Donald Trump: (01:18:08)
No. I’m talking about where people suffer massive depression,, where people commit suicide, where tremendous death happens. Now in addition to that, we’re talking about economic where you really hurt a country. It could take years and years to recover. And the longer you stay out, the harder it is to recover. I happen to think that you’re going to have, they call it the V, I think you’re going to have a very big bounce, you know, a very big bounce back. I think it’s going to be very big. We’ll see.
--
Donald Trump: (01:18:36)
Well, I think the bill should pass. It’s should pass quickly.
--
Donald Trump: (01:18:40)
Take care of our workers, take care of the companies that pay those workers, help those companies over this rough patch. But the longer it takes, the harder it is to come back. I’d like to be able to bounce back to where we were. And ultimately I think we’re going to be even further than that. But I’m just saying that the… What’s happening when I say the cure and the cure could be worse than the problem itself. Right? That’s what I, we can’t let that happen. We can’t let that happen.
--
Donald Trump: (01:19:09)
We’ve learned so much and so many good things are going to happen for our country. We can’t let this continue to go on. What we’re doing is we’re meeting with the doctors, Dr.Fauci, Dr. Birx and others and we’re, we’ve already started the discussion. And I can say that I’m a student like you’re students. We’re all learning this together. I learned a lot from Deborah. I learned a lot from Tony.
--
Donald Trump: (01:19:35)
I learned a lot from a lot of people that this is, this has been their life’s work. I’ve learned a lot. We’re going to come up with a date and we’re going to do two things. We can do two things at one time. At the same time, we’re going to be very vigilant. We’re going to be so vigilant in terms of all of the things that we have to do that we’ve been talking about for the last two weeks ad nauseum. And I think it’s going to be ultimately a far better solution for our country. Yeah, please go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:20:08)
[crosstalk 01:20:08] want her to go back and you want her to go back to work. Immediately. Thank you. Great job. Thank you, Deborah.
--
Donald Trump: (01:20:14)
Yeah, Deborah?
--
Donald Trump: (01:20:18)
They won’t let you go.
--
Donald Trump: (01:21:47)
Thank you.
--
Donald Trump: (01:21:53)
Go ahead, one second, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:22:11)
Well, it is. It’s something we’re talking to a lot of people about. We’ll see what happens, but we’re talking to people about it. Go ahead, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:22:21)
Let me just, I was just with him for a long time. And-
--
Donald Trump: (01:22:24)
Oh, he’s at the task force meeting right now.
--
Donald Trump: (01:22:28)
We have a task force meeting. He was there.
--
Donald Trump: (01:22:35)
Well, he doesn’t not agree. I mean, we had a long talk and he understands this tremendous, there’s a tremendous cost to our country, both in terms of lives and in terms of economics and in terms of many, many years of rebuilding something that was a fine tuned machine. It was nobody’s fault. It just happened. This horrible virus came from wherever and it just happened. It just happened. He fully understands that now. He’s a good man. I like Dr. Fauci a lot, just so you understand.
--
Donald Trump: (01:23:04)
No, he’s not here because we really weren’t discussing what he’s best at, but he’ll be back up very soon. Yeah, please. And we’ll be discussing dates and times with him. And we are talking about a… I don’t want to use the word abbreviated because so much has been gained by what we’ve done. But we’re talking about not during the period, you know, during the 14 or 15 days, but not too long after that-
--
Donald Trump: (01:23:33)
Which, I think is going to make a lot of people happy. It’s going to make a lot of companies happy. It’s going to make a lot of workers happy. Yeah, John?
--
Donald Trump: (01:23:46)
I would certainly, he’s very important to me and I would, I will be listening to him. I’ll be listening to Deborah, who you just spoke to. I’ll be listening to other experts. We have a lot of people that are very good at this, and ultimately, it’s a balancing act, but-
--
Donald Trump: (01:24:03)
Ultimately, it’s a balancing act, but the expression, we can do two things at one time and we’ve got an incredible country. We have to keep it that way and that includes not just economics, that also includes life and death. We have to keep it that way.
--
Donald Trump: (01:24:37)
Well, I’ve gotten to like this room. This room is very convenient. I can say from the standpoint of being president of the United States I really… This has been a very convenient room for all of us. You people are set up, so I never even thought of closing it. So you’re asking me a question that I never thought in terms of closing it. Can you give me a good reason to close it? We could build a larger one.
--
Donald Trump: (01:25:01)
I don’t want to make commitments like that because it’s not something I’ve ever really thought about. There are certain people that would like to see a larger room built. We need a larger room. Other presidents didn’t need such a large room, but we need a larger room and there are some people, but it’s not something that is really on my mind to be honest with you. Yes, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:25:29)
Which period?
--
Donald Trump: (01:25:40)
I think we’re listening to many people. I mean that was my world. I know many of those people. I have many people that are friends of mine, some enemies also by the way. But it’s been a good world for me. I like that world. I like those people. They’re tough and they’re smart. But I listened to many of them. Ultimately, they all go into that computer and I say, this is what we’re going to do. I have to make a decision. This is a very important man right here to my right, our great vice president, because he’s got a great instinct about things too. So I’m going to be listening to my case, headed up the task force I think brilliantly. I think it’s going to go down as that because he’s really done a job. Not only has he been good, he’s been soothing. He’s really been great for the American public to watch it.
--
Donald Trump: (01:26:26)
I mean that in the most positive way. There’s a solidity with Mike that you don’t find in many people. He’s been soothing. He’s been good for the American public. They have confidence in him. I think he’s done an incredible job and his advice is very, very important to me. So he’s going to be making… I mean, he didn’t come from that world, the world of finance, but he understands the world of finance. He was a great governor in Indiana. They did very well financially too.
--
Donald Trump: (01:26:55)
I can give you a whole list and we’ll probably even set up committees. I’d rather give you one because then I’m going to leave out… I have spoken to so many people and-
--
Donald Trump: (01:27:04)
What?
--
Donald Trump: (01:27:07)
I am happy with him. Yes. I think he’s… I really think he’s a caught up and he’s done the right thing and I think ultimately we will be rewarded because of the decision he made over the last… He’s really stepped up over the last week and I have to tell you, I called him today and I said, Jerome, good job. You really did it [crosstalk 01:27:29]. It might be, he was just a little bit slower than I would have liked in the sense of what he was doing. Now, other people might have liked it, but today I called up Jerome Powell and I said, “Jerome, you’ve done a really good job.” I was proud of him. That took courage and ultimately you’re going to see the fruits. Now. He’s not finished. I mean, he’s got other arrows in the quiver or whatever they say, I will tell you he’s got plenty of arrows. But no, I’m very happy with the job he did.
--
Donald Trump: (01:31:46)
No wait, I just want to say, we’re thinking about it. China has very much stepped up as you probably know, the agricultural purchases from our farmers and some other purchases too. So they have a difficult time also right now. But they’ve very much stepped up their purchases and significantly. So we’re very happy about that. The other thing, I’m standing here, this case with our vice president trying to let you ask anything you want having to do with the subject, which frankly is pretty much all anyone cares about right now. Because I think it’s very important. I don’t want to stand here for two hours and do this, but I think it’s important that I call it get it out of your system. Give us any question about it because I think it’s important for the public to know. So we don’t want to answer two questions and leave. We want to answer your questions.
--
Donald Trump: (01:32:41)
That’s why we’re doing this for so long. I think it gives our country confidence and it gives… I think we’re all gaining knowledge. This has been an unbelievable process, but we’re all getting… So I want to stay here. Sometimes we’re here for two hours and we’re answering questions. At least you will say that I’m very transparent. I think you’re going to have a hard time saying he is not transparent. But we take a lot of questions from you. Unfortunately, some of them are repetitive and some of them are fantastic questions. Some of these questions are great. Some of the questions lead to us solving a problem. You bring up problems that people didn’t know existed. But I just want to let you know so we’re doing this so that we can be transparent so that we can get everything out. Yeah, go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:33:37)
Yeah.
--
Donald Trump: (01:33:38)
We’re very, very close to them. We had a couple of great talks plus I’ve spoken to a number of them individually. Yeah, we’re very, very closely aligned. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:35:23)
That’s going to make a big difference because that really is a process that’s easy as opposed to the current process, which is not, as I’ve said, it’s not pleasant.
--
Donald Trump: (01:35:47)
Yeah. Then ultimately I have to make a decision, but I certainly listened to them. I listened to a number of people. I have a lot of respect for Dr. Fauci and for Dr. Birx and I’ll be listening to them and others that we have that are really doing good. John.
--
Donald Trump: (01:36:11)
We have now a system and the systems in place and we have two very, very powerful alternatives that we have to take into consideration. And as I said, one of the things that has really gotten me thinking about this, number one, I’m looking at what’s going on and you know it’s life is fragile and economies are fragile, but one of the things is the mortality rate, John. When we first started this, nobody knew anything about this particular virus. Very, very little. I mean we started, if we were hearing numbers of 5% that would, that’s an astronomical number when the flu is 0.001 and two and three, right? So 5% would be an astronomical number. Now we’re seeing numbers that may be less than one and that’s not including the exercise that I just went through where many people don’t report. So everybody getting very sick is reporting, but nobody getting not very sick.
--
Donald Trump: (01:37:10)
That should be part of that equation. So that just keeps reducing the number. So the mortality rate, that’s a big… To me that’s a very big factor. When we were hearing three and 4%, remember we had one day where we thought it was 5% and we’re getting a lot of bad numbers from countries that, I don’t know why, but we were getting a lot of bad numbers. I do wish, again, our relationship’s very good with China, but I wished they could have told us about this a little bit sooner. You know that. But the mortality rate is a big thing for me because I think we’re very substantially under 1% now. It’s still terrible. It’s still the whole thing. The whole concept of death is terrible, but there’s a tremendous difference between something under 1% and four or five or even 3%. So that’s something that we’re learning now. I think the number may be lower than people think because of what I’ve been saying. Yeah, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:38:13)
Well, I thought we had a deal last night and then the Democrats changed the deal. So we had a deal last night that was going to be phenomenal for the workers, which is my number one aim. I want to take care of the workers and we had a deal. I was pretty sure we had a deal last night if you would told me at a certain time about 9:00 I would have told you we pretty much have a deal. And then all of a sudden it changed. It changed fairly rapidly. It was unaccepted. It would have been bad for our country and they were asking for things that would have not been good. I mean things that that bore no relationship to what we’re talking about and we said that’s not the game. We can’t play that game. So we’ll see. Look, the Democrats do want to make a deal. But Jeff, I thought we had a deal last night.
--
Donald Trump: (01:39:07)
I’ll work with anybody to help the American people. I will. I don’t care who it is. I’ll work with anybody. If I feel I’m going to help the American people and the American worker. Yeah, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:39:28)
Well, you just saw the Admiral and you just saw the FEMA people and you just saw the army corps of engineers. We’re building hospitals in New York and California and State of Washington and New Jersey. I just made a commitment to fill that we’re going to help him out with some of the areas in New Jersey, which is very important, a great state. So, we’re doing a great job and with it to help the governors, but the governors are on the front line and they can do some of it themselves. Governor Cuomo, he’s been working very hard and he worked with me on the hospitals and medical centers because it’s not just hospitals, it’s called hospital and another is medical centers of which we’re building numerous for New York. We have it all laid out. We have Javits center and then we have other locations throughout the state.
--
Donald Trump: (01:40:22)
I think it’s really a great plan and we’re going to have FEMA and the army corps of engineers involved. I’ve worked with them we’re building a wall. We’re up to over 150 miles of wall on our Southern border, which is now turning out to be even more important than we originally thought. But I always thought it was very important having borders. So, I’m working with the army corps of engineers and I see what they do and how they do it. That’s used to be my business. I know it very well and they’re very professional. They’re really good.
--
Donald Trump: (01:40:53)
So you’re going to see a lot of good things happening in many States beyond the States. I just mentioned in many States, we’re working with governor Ron DeSantis in Florida. We’re working with governor McMaster, right? In South Carolina where they have a little bit of a breakout, not by comparison but a little bit. We’re working with many, many governors and many, many states. Actually States where you almost would think that they have it under pretty good control and they’ve done a great job, but we’re working with many states and that’s primarily FEMA and the army corps of engineer. They’re capable of doing it.
--
Donald Trump: (01:41:48)
Well, a lot of the provisions that they wanted, like stock buy backs. I agree with it. That’s good with me. I mean, I don’t like them buying back stock. I like them spending money on airplanes and on their employees and they real business, not buying back stock. I don’t know if that provision is going to be put in one way or the other. But I’m all for it and many Republicans, I can tell you are for it and I think many Democrats are for it. But they were putting that out like it was a problem last night. Not a problem for me, I can tell you that, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:42:25)
Well, I think when you’re talking about right now is at least $3,000 per family of four in that correct. $3,000 for a family of four, which is bold. If this continued, we have to build this up and if this continued we’ll do something else and we’ll do more at a later date. But that’s a big number. If you remember, they were talking about $500 and $600 and we are all for the three. As of this moment, it’s $3,000 for a family of four. Please go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:43:07)
Well, we have a very strong dollar and a strong dollar is good in many ways, but it’s also tough in many ways because it makes trade much harder. It makes it much harder for a Caterpillar tractor and other companies to sell their goods to Europe or China or wherever they may be sold. So having a strong dollar is good, but it really sounds good. But the truth is it makes certain things like trade much tougher. Our dollar, I don’t know if you’ve seen, but our dollars have been very strong, especially against other currencies, very, very strong. Which again, makes that trading more difficult. But there’s something nice about having a strong dollar, right? No matter what, I’m president, I used to have a strong dollar, but it does make trading more different.
--
Donald Trump: (01:43:53)
Well, I think the Democrats want a deal and I think we want to deal. So it would be very foolish if they didn’t make a deal. The American public is demanding it. I can tell you the Republicans want to make a deal and we want to make a deal that’s good for the workers, good for the country. I really believe the Democrats want to make a deal, but they have to stop asking for things that bear no relationship to what we’re talking about.
--
Donald Trump: (01:44:16)
That are actually bad. That are actually not good for the country.
--
Donald Trump: (01:44:33)
Well, let’s see what happens. I have to see what happens. Right now we don’t have a deal, but I think we’re very close. I mean, when I left, which was quite a while ago now, because again, we’re trying to answer every question so there’s no… Be nice if you were just exhausted and said, “That’s it. We can’t do any more.” But there’s always hands up. Maybe one of those questions is great and unique, but now look I want what’s good for the country and if that means meeting, I think that’s great. I just want what’s good for the country, great for our workers, great for the citizens of the United States. That’s all it [crosstalk 01:45:04]-
--
Donald Trump: (01:45:07)
It’s been a little. Yeah, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:45:16)
Yes.
--
Donald Trump: (01:45:18)
She’s great. She’s fine.
--
Donald Trump: (01:45:22)
Negative.
--
Donald Trump: (01:45:33)
Well, we need that to help all of these companies that have a chance of not being companies anymore, and that’s going to be a good thing for the country because deals will be made and we’re talking to certain people. Some of the greatest people in the history of Wall Street, frankly. Where when they do a deal, we’ll have stock for America. We’ll take back stock for the United States. At the same time, most importantly, we’ll keep those companies healthy, but we can also make incredible deals for the country so that that number will increase exponentially. I mean, this is
--
Donald Trump: (01:46:16)
Oh look, I’ll be the oversight. I’ll be the oversight. We’re going to make good deals. We make good deals, but these companies need it. Even if it was just a simple loan, which would be. But we can do better than that and the companies are willing to do better than that. I mean, they got hit. Most of these companies, it was through no fault of their own. There are a couple where they were troubled before they came in. We talked about one, it had troubled, nobody can believe it actually in that one.
--
Donald Trump: (01:46:42)
But these companies are through no fault of their own. They have difficulty. I mean, two weeks ago, these companies were among the most solid institutions in the world. You’d want to buy their bonds, their bonds were rated AAA or whatever their highest rating is today. Now all of a sudden they have difficulty because they’ve been closed up. So you need something to keep them going, but that money is not going to be wasted money. That money’s going to be seen. We could multiply that number by many times coming back to the American public, that could be a phenomenal thing. But most importantly, it’s going to keep these great engines of jobs and ingenuity going. Very important. How about one or two more and we’ll go. Go ahead please [crosstalk 01:47:28].
--
Donald Trump: (01:47:34)
I don’t think so. I’m looking forward. I don’t look back. I guess there’s always something everybody regrets. There things in your life you regret. We all regret things, but I really like to look forward. I’m a person that looks… Forward thinker. I guess they would say. No, I think that we’ve handled it really well. It seems to be the American public thinks that we’ve handled it well. If you look at polling data, but I’m not interested in myself. I’m interested in the American people. We have to get this going. We have millions and millions of jobs that were solid as a rock three weeks ago and today there could be questions.
--
Donald Trump: (01:48:11)
The faster we get it going, the more likely it is that those stores, little businesses, big businesses, medium sized businesses open up and we’ll get it going very fast. I really believe this is a pent up demand. I think that as soon as we say, “Let’s go.” It’s going to be pretty soon. It’s going to be pretty soon. It’s going to be sooner than people would think. Again, we’re in a position to take care of our country, but at the same time to have the country really, really go up like a rocket ship economically. That’s great for jobs. It’s great for everything else. Yeah, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:48:50)
For who?
--
Donald Trump: (01:48:59)
Well that’s really up to the governor. I mean I think first of all, he’s a great governor. He’s done an incredible job. Governor DeSantis of Florida and on the beaches, I guess he’s recently made a decision, but you do have a lot of room on the beaches. I think it’s just a decision that he made originally and then he’s refined it and then he’s done something that a lot of people agree with what he’s done, but he’s done a lot of things right. He’s been truly… I mean, he cares so much about health care, he cares so much about the cost of prescription drugs. He’s been a fantastic governor for Florida. They’re very happy with them.
--
Donald Trump: (01:49:38)
The whole concept of the beach, it’s a very interesting issue. There are a lot of open spaces that includes parks and other things, but rather than relying on social distancing, they’re probably going to do that one in a different way. But I would imagine when we make our decision, things like that would be opened up and then people will remember what they’re supposed to be doing. Well, I want to thank everybody very much and we’ll see you tomorrow sometime and we’ll get this going, I think really well. Thank you all very much. Appreciate it [inaudible 01:50:04].
Donald Trump: (01:03)
Thank you very much. Great to have you, and thank you all for being here. My administration is taking new action to ensure that America has the medical resources and equipment needed to fight the global pandemic. It’s been a brutal pandemic for over 150 countries all over the world. We’ve had great success over the last month. We’ve, as you know, the millions and millions of pieces of equipment have been delivered successfully by us, purchased and delivered, and we’ve made it available to the states and the governors have been very gracious, for the most part, I would say. A couple that aren’t appreciative of the incredible job, they have to do a better job themselves. That’s part of the problem. But generally speaking, I have to tell you the governors have been great. I just spoke to the governor of New Jersey, Governor Murphy, and he’s very thankful and Governor Cuomo has been very nice.
--
Donald Trump: (02:09)
They’ve really appreciated, I think, what the federal government has done, you look at the hospitals that are being built all over the country by the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA. It’s been really incredible. Nobody has seen it. They’ll build hospitals in two or three days, portable hospitals. This afternoon I invoked the Defense Production Act to compel General Motors to accept, perform, prioritize federal contracts for ventilators. Ventilators are a big deal and we’ve delivered thousands of them, and oftentimes you don’t need ventilators very much, hospitals don’t have very many, and now we’re turning out that we have to produce large numbers, but we’ve been able to do that and we’re going to be doing a lot more. This invocation of the DPA should demonstrate clearly to all that we will not hesitate to use the full authority of the federal government to combat this crisis. We thought that we had a deal with, as an example, General Motors and I guess they thought otherwise they didn’t agree and now they do.
--
Donald Trump: (03:15)
They do agree and I think we might be able to pull it, but we let them know the way we felt and they can’t be doing that. We’ll work in partnership with the private sector, but where an emergency exists and it’s very important that we get to the bottom line and quickly we will do what we have to do and immediately exercise all available awful authorities to get the job done. This afternoon I also signed an executive order investing, and very, very strongly investing the Department of Health and Human Services, and the department of Homeland Security with the full authorities available under the Defense Production Act to respond to the outbreak of the terrible virus, the invisible enemy, as we say. My order also establishes that Peter Navarro, a very trusted person from the White House and he’s been an incredible … He’s done an incredible job for me in terms of negotiation, in terms of understanding where the world is going economically, but my order establishes that Peter will serve as national Defense Production Act policy coordinator for the federal government.
--
Donald Trump: (04:30)
That’s a very important position, more important probably than it’s almost ever been in our country, and so I want to congratulate Peter and his family. It’s a … I know he’s going to do a fantastic job. He’s been doing that job over the last few weeks. Peter is a PhD in economics from Harvard, has a master in public administration from the Kennedy School, also from Harvard, and he’s a tremendous guy and he will do a fantastic job. But I’d like to maybe ask before I continue Peter to say a few words, please.
--
Donald Trump: (07:12)
Thank you, Peter. Good luck. My administration is marshaling the full power of the American government and we will do that and that’s what we’ve done and we will continue to do it until our war is won. Economic, scientific, medical, military and Homeland Security. All of this to vanquish the virus. We are working to sign contracts immediately with the major ventilator companies in the country, including GE, Phillips, Medtronic, Hamilton, Zol, Resmed, Hillrob and Viar. These are all companies that do this, great companies, the FDA will be reducing and waving unnecessary regulations in order to get this done, we’re going to be getting rid of certain, let’s say, barriers to speed. We want them to get it done quickly. They’ve been doing it for a long time. They’ve been making ventilators for a long time. Hopefully General Motors will join in the fray, under the normal condition that you would be.
--
Donald Trump: (08:22)
Regular times, 29,000 ventilators are distributed in the United States each year. In the next 100 days … Well, first of all we’ve already delivered thousands of them, but within the next 100 days we will either make or get in some form over 100,000 additional units. And I guess to put it in other words, in the next 100 days we’ll receive over three times the number of ventilators made during a regular year in the United States. And that doesn’t include all of the thousands and thousands that we’ve given to the various states, a lot of them.
--
Donald Trump: (08:59)
We delivered thousands, as you know, to New York and they didn’t know they got them. And then we also had thousands put in a warehouse and that was also for New York and they just found out that they were there. So we have to make sure that when we deliver things, they get distributed. Earlier today I spoke to the CEO of Boeing, Dave Calhoun, and Boeing will be producing and donating face shields to help our medical professionals on the front lines. These are actually pretty intricate in terms of the plastic and the quality of the materials. They’re important. They’ve got to be top of the line and they’ll go into do thousands of these a week. They’ve already tested the production and they’re ready to begin producing all of these shields. It’s the plastic shields that go over the face. Boeing is also offering us the use of their, what they call the dream lifter cargo plane.
--
Donald Trump: (09:59)
It’s the largest plane in the world and this is sort of a picture of it. They called up just a little while ago and that can sort of take anything, that’s the biggest in the world and they’re letting us use that for the distribution of product all over the country, especially the heavy product or large quantities of product, and Boeing will dedicate up to three planes to the mission of flying medical supplies anywhere we needed. Each plane can carry 63, 000 pounds of cargo per flight. That’s a lot of cargo.
--
Donald Trump: (10:35)
I also signed an executive order giving the Department of defense and Department of Homeland Security the authority to activate the ready reserve components of the armed forces. This will allow us to mobilize medical disaster and emergency response personnel to help wage our battle against the virus by activating thousands of experienced service members, including retirees. We have a lot of people, retirees, great, great military people, they’re coming back in who have offered to support the nation in this extraordinary time of need. And they come back in. They don’t say, “How much?” They don’t say, “What are we getting paid?” They just want to come back in. It’s really an incredible thing to see. It’s beautiful.
--
Donald Trump: (11:19)
This afternoon I also signed into law 2.2 trillion dollars in urgently needed relief for our nation’s families, workers, businesses, and Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. And the 2.2 trillion goes to 6.2 trillion depending on need. So it’s the largest bill ever signed and not just emergency relief, but of any kind. We’ve never signed a bill of that magnitude, and incredibly it was 96 to nothing in the Senate and it was essentially the same thing in congress, they did it very quickly in the house. They did it very, very quickly.
--
Donald Trump: (12:01)
So if you look at Congress, what they’ve been able to do, the house was a voice vote, I guess they would call it, and something like that rarely takes place, and 96 to nothing in the Senate for the largest bill in the history of our country. That’s pretty good. And I want to thank Republicans, I want to thank Democrats for coming together for the whole of the nation and this is a great thing, a great victory. This is going to save companies that are incredible companies, but that are going to need some help because of what happened. A month ago, they were outstanding. They were having the best year they ever had and then we got hit and so we’ll help them out. It’s thousands and millions of jobs, millions of jobs. And I just want to thank everybody for working so hard. And that includes the people standing with me right here.
--
Donald Trump: (12:55)
The legislation extends a vital lifeline to American families and American workers with job retention loans for small businesses, and a big focus of the bill is small businesses. They’re really … They’re the energy, they’re whatever you want to call it in terms of our nation that push … People have no idea how big a factor Peter can tell you, the small businesses are in this country from an economic standpoint, from a job standpoint. We expand the unemployment benefits for workers very substantially and direct cash payments will be going to American citizens. Substantial. This legislation also provides a massive increase in funding for hospitals for the disaster relief fund, and critical supplies including masks, respirators, and pharmaceuticals of all types. And speaking of pharmaceuticals, as you know, we’re working on vaccines. We’re getting some good response and we’re working on therapeutics and cures and we have some very interesting things happening. This afternoon, Apple launched a new tool created in partnership with our task force, the CDC and FEMA. Any individual who is concerned that they might have the virus can now download the free C-O-V-I-D dash 19 app on their iPhone and answer a set of simple questions about their symptoms and risk factors. It’s getting to be a very modernized system indeed. They’ll soon receive HHS recommendations on what to do next, including whether they should get tested or not. And again, we only want people to get tested if they … If we think they need it. In a few moments. Secretary Devoss and Secretary Perdue will discuss new partnerships with the private sector that are providing meals to millions of students while schools are closed. They’ve both been incredible, the job they’ve done. I appreciate them very much. We’re grateful for the assistance of Niren Chadhaury, CEO of Panera Bread Company, they’ve been so incredible to us and to the people of our country. And Denton McClain, chairman of McClain Global Logistics, and they’ve joined us. They’re on stage with me. They’re going to speak.
--
Donald Trump: (15:14)
Throughout this ordeal, I’ve been ordered and inspired by the American people more than anything else, more than anyone else. Americans of every walk of life have followed the guidelines shown incredible compassion and sacrifice greatly on behalf of their fellow citizens. I want every American to know that their selfless and heroic actions are saving lives and I want them to know, and I’ve said it before, that I’m very proud to be their president, I’m very proud of the American people. My administration is actively planning the next phase in an all out war against this horrible virus. We’re now testing nearly 100,000 patients per day, more than anybody in the world and we have now, as of even a couple of weeks ago, tested more than any other country in the world, and our capacity continues to grow.
--
Donald Trump: (16:05)
Widespread surveillance testing will allow us to monitor the spread of the virus and we’re doing that quite accurately, and Deborah and Tony will be speaking about that and coordinate with the States to contain new hotspots as they arise with a targeted, fact-based and data-based approach. It’s all data driven. This surveillance testing will soon enable us to publish updated guidelines for state and local leaders. We want every county and region in the country to have the on-the-ground evidence that they need to determine the mitigation measures that are right for them. Each location is different. Some are very, very different. Some are day and night, some are in great shape and some aren’t in great shape, and we’ll be able to have very accurate information very shortly. We already have a lot of that information. America’s bravely battling this pandemic through cutting edge science and medical innovation and rational, deliberate and determined vigilance.
--
Donald Trump: (17:07)
No effort will be spared in winning this war. We’re going to win the war. Hopefully we’re going to win soon and with as few lives as possible lost. You see what’s going on all over the world, you see the lives, you see Italy, you see Spain, you see all of these countries going through so much, going through such hell and we’re all in very strong communication. I can tell you our professionals are dealing with them every day. Many of the countries, so many countries, but many of the countries we’re dealing very directly and closely, and we’re going to be in very good shape in terms of certain equipment that’s very hard to get, very hard to manufacture, and at the right time will be distributing that equipment throughout the world to other countries.
--
Donald Trump: (17:51)
Boris Johnson was asking for ventilators today, as you know, Boris is … He’s tested … Unfortunately he’s tested positive and it’s a terrible thing, but he’s going to be great. I’m sure he’s going to be totally great, but they want ventilators, Italy wants ventilators, Spain wants ventilators, Germany wants ventilators, they’re all calling for ventilators. Well, we’re going to make a lot of ventilators and we’ll take care of our needs, but we’re also going to help other countries.
--
Donald Trump: (18:20)
So I just want to thank everybody. I want to thank our great American citizens and a lot of incredible things are happening, really happening, and it’s too bad … I was saying before we had the press conference when we signed, we had a signing ceremony where we signed the largest bill in our history. And I said, “Think of it, 22 days ago, we had the greatest economy in the world. Everything was going beautifully. The stock market hit an all time high again for the over 150th time during my presidency, and the world was looking good. And then we got hit by the invisible enemy.” And now you have countries all over the world reeling. But we’re winning it and we’ll be a bigger and better and stronger than where we were even before. And we will also have apparatus in place that works. We won’t have broken systems, we’ll have incredible systems. So if this should happen again, hopefully it won’t. But if a thing like this should happen again, we’ll be able to handle it very much more easily. So with that I’ll take a few questions [inaudible 00:19:33].
--
Donald Trump: (19:40)
Well, it got to be a debate about cost, and we don’t want to think too much about cost when we’re talking about this. This is not cost. I wasn’t happy where general motors built plants and other locations over the years, not so much during my term, but they built a lot of plants in other countries. I won’t name the countries, but you can imagine. And so I didn’t go into it with a very favorable view. I was extremely unhappy with Lordstown, Ohio, where they left Lordstown, Ohio in the middle of an auto boom because we had 17 car companies coming in and then they were leaving one plant in Ohio. I love Ohio.
--
Donald Trump: (20:15)
And what happens? That became the story. Not that all these plants are moving in, but that you had a one plant, they were leaving. And frankly I think that would be a good place to build the ventilators. But we’ll see. We’ll see how that all works out. But so I wasn’t too thrilled. And then we thought we had a deal for 40,000 ventilators and all of a sudden it became six and then price became a big object. But Peter Navarro’s going to handle that and Peter will do a very good job. We’ll see, maybe they’ll change their tune, but we didn’t want to play games with them.
--
Donald Trump: (21:01)
The quarantine orders.
--
Donald Trump: (21:12)
I think I’m going to let Tony speak to that a little bit later. But we’re being very strong on quarantine. We’re being very strong on people not leaving, especially certain states and going to other states where they have less of a problem. I mean, you’re hearing constantly about people leaving New York and going down to Florida, and New York obviously is a hot spot and that’s why we’re building all those hospitals in New York and all those medical centers in New York. So we’ll let Tony answer to that, but specifically you have to understand, we’re not playing games. John?
--
Donald Trump: (22:08)
It wasn’t after, it was before and we just were not getting there with General Motors. We weren’t getting there. We’re getting there with a lot of other companies and we have the people that are doing it for me in the room right here and we can talk to you later about it, but we have to get these people on board. We’re not looking to get into a big deal on price. We’re not looking to be ripped off on price. We don’t want prices to be double, triple what they should be. So General Motors, we’ll see what happens. But now they’re talking, but they weren’t talking the right way at the beginning and that was not right to the country.
--
Donald Trump: (22:50)
I think there’s a very good chance we won’t need that many. And I think frankly there’s a great chance that we’re not going to need that money. But you know what, there are a lot of other people that are going to need them. We have countries all over the world that are friends of ours and we will help those countries. We’re in a position to do things that other countries can’t. So we have a sort of an interesting position we can make them, because we’re going to be making over 100,000 pretty quickly. So we can make them. And if we don’t need them, John, that’s okay because we can help Italy and we can help UK, Boris Johnson specifically. I mean when I say, “How you feeling?” And the first thing Boris said to me is, “We need ventilators.”
--
Donald Trump: (23:29)
We’re not going to be keeping them. All over the world, they want them, and we’re in a position to make them and other countries aren’t. Okay?
--
Donald Trump: (23:46)
Well, if you look, and I think you can ask that question best of Deborah, but I think their estimates are high. I hope they’re high. They could be extremely high. We’re doing even hospitals based on pretty high estimates, I’m doing them anyway and as I told John, “If we do not need them, that’ll be wonderful. We can help a lot of great people all over the world. We can help them live.” But I think his estimates are going to be very high. We’re going to see. Don’t forget, we sent thousands of ventilators to New York and they didn’t know they got them. Then we sent thousands of ventilators to New York, they have a warehouse a New York, warehouse in Edison, New Jersey, which is an interesting thing. And we sent them to Edison, New Jersey. They were in the warehouse, ready to go, and New York never took them.
--
Donald Trump: (24:32)
So they knew they were there. So we have to get people lined up, but we’ve given the … And I’m not blaming New York. Look, this is something that’s of a magnitude that nobody’s ever seen before. But I’ll tell you what, the federal government’s done a hell of a job. So we sent thousands of ventilators to New York and they didn’t know about it at the time they were complaining. Thousands. We had 2,000 and then 2,000 and then 4,000, and they were going there in large numbers. And then before that we sent many thousands. We want to have so many-
--
Donald Trump: (25:03)
And then before that we said many thousands. We want to have so many that we do have more than we need, because we can send them to other great countries, other countries that have been our friends and they’ll never be able to do it themselves. Yeah, please?
--
Donald Trump: (25:25)
Well, I think we’ve done a great job for the State of Washington and I think the governor, who is a failed presidential candidate as you know, he leveled out at zero in the polls, he’s constantly chirping, and I guess complaining would be a nice way of saying it. We’re building hospitals. We’ve done a great job for the State of Washington. Michigan, she has no idea what’s going on. And all she does is say, “Oh, it’s the federal government’s fault.” And we’ve taken such great care of Michigan. You know the care we’ve taken of New Jersey.
--
Donald Trump: (25:54)
I think if you ask Governor Murphy of New Jersey, “How are we doing?” I think he’d say great. I think. He’s a Democrat. Governor Cuomo has really said we’re really doing a great job, and I saw the news conference where he was thanking the people from FEMA, the people from Army Corps of Engineers this morning. I mean, they built a hospital like in three and a half days, and it’s a big hospital in the Javits Center. And they’re building medical facilities in different parts of New York, and Governor Cuomo has been appreciative. But a couple of people aren’t. We have done a hell of a job. The federal government has really stepped up.
--
Donald Trump: (26:32)
All I want them to do, very simple, I want them to be appreciative. I don’t want them to say things that aren’t true. I want them to be appreciative. We’ve done a great job, and I’m not talking about me. I’m talking about Mike Pence, the Task Force, I’m talking about FEMA, the Army Corps of Engineers. There’s no country in the world could have done what the Army Corps of Engineers has done and is doing. Now they’re going in and building literal… They’re going into hotels and renovating hotels. That should be for governors to do. That should be for states to do.
--
Donald Trump: (27:04)
We have the Army Corps of Engineers so teed up and so stocked up and they’re really psyched and they’re incredible, and there’s no games with these people. They’re in there screaming, “Get it done, get it done.” There’s not sitting around taking it easy. These are workers. These are incredible people. So I think the Army Corps of Engineers… When somebody for political reasons wants to blame, I view that as blaming these incredible people. Nobody’s ever seen it. I don’t know if you’ve been to the Javits Center.
--
Donald Trump: (27:32)
Now, I’ve seen it. I would love to go there, but with all that we’re doing, we will be tomorrow at the hospital. We have this incredible hospital boat. It was supposed to be ready in three and a half weeks, because it’s under maintenance, a big maintenance contract. We were able to get it done quickly. We were able to stock it up to the top and it’s leaving tomorrow at 2:00. It’s leaving Virginia. It’ll be in New York on Monday, weeks ahead of schedule. I think things, even the media, I think the media and governors should appreciate it.
--
Donald Trump: (28:05)
And I have to say, the media has been pretty good and the governors have been really good, except for a couple. And with them, it’s just political. “How’s Trump doing?” “Oh, well, I don’t know.” Because we have done a job the likes of which nobody’s seen.
--
Donald Trump: (28:22)
I think they should be appreciative. Because you know what? When they’re not appreciative to me, they’re not appreciative to the Army Corps, they’re not appreciative to FEMA, it’s not right. These people are incredible. They’re working 24 hours a day. I mean, Mike Pence, I don’t think he sleeps anymore. These are people that should be appreciated. He calls all the governors. I tell him… I mean, I’m a different type of person. I say, “Mike, don’t call the Governor of Washington. You’re wasting your time with him. Don’t call the woman in Michigan.” It doesn’t make any difference what happens-
--
Donald Trump: (28:54)
You know what I say? If they don’t treat you right, I don’t call. He’s a different type of person. He’ll call quietly anyway, okay? But he’s done a great job. He should be appreciated for the job he’s done. Yes, ma’am?
--
Donald Trump: (29:17)
No, but I have spirit for the country. I mean, we have sailors, we have doctors on that ship. We have everything. I mean, I’m not going to be a jumping around in a huddle, but yeah, I think it’s a great sign, the President of the United States. They got a ship out of maintenance, completed all the work in a fraction of the time. It was supposed to be there for three and a half additional weeks and they got it done, and it’s in great shape and they’re sending it up.
--
Donald Trump: (29:43)
So the answer… It’s a good question. It’s a fair question. I just feel that as the leader of our country, when they can do work like they’ve done, and they’ve been working all day, all night, medical supplies, everything loading up that ship, I don’t think it’s the worst thing in the world. It’s right down the road practically, right? Virginia. And I think it’s great if I go to Virginia. I guess I can take helicopter or plane. It’s a tiny trip. And I think it’s a good thing when I go over there and I say thank you. It doesn’t mean I’m going to be hugging people and it doesn’t mean that I’m going to be shaking people’s hands and everything, but I think it sends a signal when the president is able to go there and say thank you. So, we’ll be careful. Peter?
--
Donald Trump: (30:38)
Yeah, I did. We did fill it twice. We filled it twice and we’ve been distributing that for literally a year. We’ve been filling it [crosstalk 00:30:46]. That’s a nice question, Peter. Thank you very much. We’ve been filling it out and we’ve been filling that stockpile many, many times. It’s been filled many, many times. And now what we’re doing is something different, because I think it’s better. We’d fill it so it comes from wherever the point of manufacturer or whatever is, we fill it and then we go, “Now it’s full.” Now we take it and we distribute around. Now what we’re doing is, we have an emergency. We’re saying, “Go direct, go direct, go direct.” We fill it only where necessary, but now we’re trying to go direct.
--
Donald Trump: (31:16)
So they drop it off in New York or they drop it off in Michigan. They drop it off in Virginia, wherever it may be, Florida. Florida is getting a lot of things. And we’re finding it’s a much better system, but we’ve filled and we’ve stockpiled many, many times. Yeah, we ended up with an empty shelf. Yes, please?
--
Donald Trump: (31:42)
So, I had a great conversation with the President of China last night, pretty late in the night. It was fascinating to me. They have a whole… It’s a different kind of a world. It’s a different form of government, to put it mildly. We talked for a long time. We talked for at least an hour, I guess. And one of the things I was asking him is, “When did you notice that this was happening?” We talked about the whole concept, how it happened, when it happened, what was the most effective use? I mean, was it the fact that distance… Was distance the best thing? We talked about everything.
--
Donald Trump: (32:21)
And he’s gotten and developed… Because they’re ahead of us from the standpoint of time. It happened there actually long before it happened here. By the way, it would have happened here a lot sooner had we not kept those people out, the Chinese people coming over to the country, had we not kept them out. But we talked about it, because he’s had additional experience of having been much earlier. And he’s developed some incredible theories and all of that information is coming over here. A lot of it’s already come. The data, we call it data, and we’re going to learn a lot from what the Chinese went through.
--
Donald Trump: (32:59)
Our relationship with China is very good. We also talked about the trade agreement, but I must tell you, this whole invisible enemy has taken over the world. Nobody cares about trade, nobody cares about anything. You want to talk about trade, they immediately get back to this. So we really did, we talked about trade. They’re starting to buy very heavily from the farmers under the agreement, under the trade deal that we just signed. But honestly, he, me, all of us, everybody’s talking. You turn on television, you read the papers, it’s all about this.
--
Donald Trump: (33:33)
And you know what? It probably should be mostly about this. It’s hard to talk about, “Hey, how you doing with buying from the farmers?” They have started very, very large buying, as you probably have read. But what we really focused on was this-
--
Donald Trump: (33:49)
I also said, “How have you done with cures? And how have you done with respect to vaccines?” We discussed that. And they’re doing like we’re doing. They’re working on it very hard. They think they have some interesting things have been determined, and we’ll see what happens. But we talked a lot about vaccine. We talked a lot about possible cures. How good would that be? I mean, that’s a game changer. So, we’ll see.
--
Donald Trump: (34:14)
And by the way, we have various things happening right now having to do with cures and vaccines. And I think we’re doing very well, especially in the vaccine thing. I think we’re very close. But as Tony will tell you, that’s a long testing process. So, we’ll see what happens.
--
Donald Trump: (34:33)
He never asked me to suspend tariffs, no. We’re taking in billions of dollars. He never did ask me that. John?
--
Donald Trump: (34:52)
So John, I’ll be sitting down with this brilliant woman and this brilliant man, and lots of brilliant people that work with them, I think. Right, Deborah and Tony? And we’ll be sitting down on Monday or maybe Tuesday, depending on which is the best for everybody, and we’ll be making that determination. Okay? We’ll be making it.
--
Donald Trump: (35:09)
And by the way, obviously we’re not doing it for New York. You see New York is just coming into this really heated situation. We’re building a lot of things in New York right now that nobody thought would ever be building. A lot of things are happening in New York, so obviously… But we are talking about possibly other parts of the country which really aren’t affected to any major degree. Or maybe we won’t do that, because maybe at the advice of a lot of very talented people that do this for a living, they won’t want to do that. They won’t want to expose anything. They want to do it all at one time. These are the kinds of things we’ll be talking about.
--
Donald Trump: (35:47)
Well, it depends. We do want to flatten the curve. We want to see that curve start heading down in the other direction at a minimum. And we really have to talk about areas of the country that have not been affected or certainly have had a very small affect. And we’ll see. I certainly want to get it open as soon as possible. I don’t want it to be long, but we also want it to open safe. Otherwise, what did we do?
--
Donald Trump: (36:13)
I hope not. I hope it’s going to be sooner. I hope it disappears faster than that. I really think that the people of our country have done a great job. Last night, I was watching and I’m looking down Madison Avenue and Fifth Avenue, John, there were no people in the street. I mean, normally you wouldn’t be able to see the sidewalk. There’d be cars all over, it’d be like rush hour stuff. I’m looking at it and I’m saying, “I can’t believe it. There are no cars, there are no people.” There wasn’t one person on Fifth Avenue walking down the street. I’ve never seen that before. I guess maybe at 1:00 in the morning, 4:00 in the morning maybe. But I’ve never seen that before. The people have been incredible.
--
Donald Trump: (36:55)
When you talk about distancing, social distancing, I mean, we don’t have a law. We’re not going to put them in jail. And yet, they’re really… I think there’s two things. Number one, they are afraid. And number two, they really are wanting to win this thing. Yes, please?
--
Donald Trump: (37:34)
Sure.
--
Donald Trump: (37:38)
Sure. That’s a good question. We have brilliant people. We have a tremendous amount of money, and we have brilliant people that I’m taking from Wall Street with secretary Mnuchin, who’s done an incredible job, but brilliant guy, I’m taking from Wall Street people that I’ve known, that you all know, the top people in the world. They don’t want money. I mean, will they get something? I guess maybe they’ll get, who knows? Peanuts what they want compared to what they would normally get. I’m taking the smartest, the most brilliant people in the world in finance and they’re going to be dealing.
--
Donald Trump: (38:12)
I’m not going to hire somebody that’s never done it, that’s a political person or anything else. We’re getting the most brilliant financial minds in the world. I know all of them, you know all of them. I mean, you read about all of them. I guess some you don’t read about, and they’re probably the smartest of them all. But the fact is, we’re taking these brilliant people and they’ll be dealing with United and they want to help.
--
Donald Trump: (38:35)
Look, I’ll tell you right now, the airline business has always been a tough business. It’s always been a very tough business, tough to make money with. Every barrier you can have, that business has. But for our country, it’s very important. We have to take care of our country. We need the airlines to stay. It’s also big for jobs. So, we will be able to handle United and we’ll be able to handle Delta and we’ll be able to handle all of it. We have plenty of money.
--
Donald Trump: (39:00)
Now, will we end up owning large chunks, depending on what these great geniuses decide along with the executives of the different companies? It’s possible, and they’ll make a better deal on the loan, but the taxpayer will then end up owning a big chunk of companies. As an example, Boeing. Boeing until a year ago was the greatest company, I think in the world by far. To me, there wasn’t anything close. I believe it was 1% of GDP. Okay? Think of that. One company, 1% of GDP. It was flawless. Then it had the problems and then it had on top of it, this whole thing with the virus. So Boeing will probably need a hand, and we’re going to bring Boeing back to health.
--
Donald Trump: (39:41)
But we have the smartest people in the world. I don’t even know if you know that. I think this could be the first time you’ve heard it. People like Larry Fink we’re talking to, that’s BlackRock, and we have the smartest people and they all want to do it. I mean, this to them, they will… They love this country. They all want to do it. So, we’re speaking to people like that and they’ll be able to work it out.
--
Donald Trump: (40:14)
No, I think they’re the same thing. I mean, bringing people back to health and protecting people’s jobs. To me, and I’m okay at this stuff, that’s the same thing. I’m in a much different position as president than if I were an investor or something, but I want to bring them back to health, because I want to preserve their jobs. But I also want to preserve airlines, because that’s preserving lots of other jobs. That’s preserving the travel and leisure industry, which is perhaps the largest industry in our country if you add it all up. You add up all the hotels and all the traveling and all the planes and everything else, probably by far the largest industry in our country.
--
Donald Trump: (40:51)
So saving the airlines is very important. And the airlines were all doing well. The airlines were doing record business a month before this today, let’s say. Even 22 days to be exact, right? When we first started seeing some real signs of problems, they were at record levels. Last year they had a record year. The biggest in the history of the airlines. Everybody was doing well. I mean, I was presiding over the most successful economy in the history of the world. And now we’re going to have to rebuild it, and I think we’re going to have an absolute incredible fourth quarter. And maybe it’s slightly after that to be honest, but it’s going to be in that time period. As soon as we get rid of this, I think we’re going to have an explosion upward. It’s going to be incredible. Please?
--
Donald Trump: (41:49)
That’s true.
--
Donald Trump: (41:54)
I do, because he’s a very talented guy. He’s a very good governor. Everyone loves him. He’s doing a fantastic job for Florida. He was not happy with the people coming down from New York. They’re flying down from New York, and he had a state and has a state, with obviously a lot less problems. Florida has been doing really well in the sense of testing. The testing has shown much better results. Maybe they’ll talk to you about that later.
--
Donald Trump: (42:20)
But no, he was very unhappy with the people coming down from New York, and I understand that. No, Ron’s a very tough guy. He’s a great governor and I have tremendous confidence in him. And he had the beach situation. He resolved that. He will get it all resolved. Yeah, please?
--
Donald Trump: (42:52)
You have to go louder. You’re going to have to speak louder.
--
Donald Trump: (43:05)
We have some very, very strong restrictions. But you’re right, I don’t like it. So, we’re seeing how it works. The data is coming in on Monday and Tuesday, and we’re going to see how it looks. But can we go to a tougher level? We can, but that causes other problems. We’re going to see, and we’ll be reporting back very shortly after my meetings with Tony, Deborah, and others that we’re going to be meeting with, and our vice president. And we’re going to be reporting back to the media. Okay? Please, corner?
--
Donald Trump: (43:39)
Yes.
--
Donald Trump: (44:03)
I would say that you are a citizen of the greatest country anywhere in the world. And we were attacked like nothing that’s happened possibly since 1917, many, many years ago. We were attacked, and we’re winning the battle and we’re going to win, and it’s not going to take hopefully that much longer, but we have to win the war. And I would say that they have a duty to sit back, watch, behave, wash their hands, stay in the apartment with mom and dad. They look like they’re lucky to have you as a father. And just learn from it.
--
Donald Trump: (44:41)
But the young people have been tremendous. Some of them are very happy not to go to school. You understand that. Perhaps yours, perhaps not. We have literally had no problem. But again, they should just sit back and be very proud of our country, because we’re doing it for them. Ultimately, we’re doing it for them more than anything else if you think about it.
--
Donald Trump: (45:06)
The other thing that’s nice and the one thing that has come out, and I learned this, again it was reaffirmed by president Xi last night in my conversation, the young people are really, this is an incredible phenomenon, but they are attacked, successfully attacked to a much lesser extent by this pandemic, by this disease, this whatever they want to call it. You can call it a germ, you can call it a flu, you can call it a virus, you can call it many different names. I’m not sure anybody even knows what it is, but the children do very well. It’s almost the younger they are, the better they do. I guess the immune system is… Sadly, for some of us, their immune system is stronger. But actually, I’m very happy about that.
--
Donald Trump: (45:52)
But they have been attacked. For instance, the Spanish flu, and if you look at the H1N1, if you take a look at the swine flu, which was as you know not so long ago, that attacked very young children, kids, middle age people, everyone. Age is a factor here, so your children should be in good shape, but just tell them to be very proud of the country. Okay?
--
Donald Trump: (46:24)
Well, we’re going to make that determination. And you’re going to have something to do with that. I mean, look, we’re going to be guided also. You have some real strong feelings, the media. I’ll tell you what, the media generally… I mean, I’m impressed. A lot of the media has been fair. I’m not used to fair treatment in the media. I don’t know how to handle it, but overall I think the media has been pretty fair. Some not. I mean, I could tell you who, but what’s the point? But the media has really been fair. I mean, they view this as we’re all in a problem together and we’re going to win. We’re going to win. Please?
--
Donald Trump: (47:24)
Well, that’s not happening. I mean, I think they wrote us out and that’s all right. But that’s not happening. As far as the Mayor of New York, I’ll be honest, I didn’t know him well. He and I are obviously opposite persuasion and we would go at it, but we didn’t… I don’t know if we ever spoke to other than to maybe say hello a couple of times. I did down at the World Trade Center Memorial once a long time ago.
--
Donald Trump: (47:52)
So, I’ve spoken to him a lot, Mayor de Blasio, and we’ve really had incredibly productive discussions. I’ve gotten him a lot of people. We’ve gotten him a medical center he’s asked for at Elmhurst. I know Elmhurst Hospital very well. I mean, that was an area of Queens that I grew up in. And boy, you talk about an epicenter. That’s really the epicenter of the epicenter. That’s really something. We talked about it, because that was very close to where I grew up. And knowing it, being so familiar with it, it’s incredible to see where they have the trucks. I don’t have to go into great detail. The refrigerated trucks coming up, and I’ve never seen anything like it.
--
Donald Trump: (48:37)
I’ve spoken with Mayor de Blasio a lot in the last week. We’ve helped him, I think a lot, and I’ve really gotten to like him. I get along with him very well. Now, he wants us to do certain things and we’ve produced. I mean, today I spoke to him with the Secretary of Defense Esper, and we had a great conversation and we’re helping him get some of the things he needs. I don’t have to go into great detail, but he’s very happy about what we’re able to do for him today. And he’s like us. He’s working very hard. But I can’t say anything bad about Mayor de Blasio. I mean, my relationship with him over the last couple of weeks has been excellent and we’ve done a good job for him too. Yeah, please?
--
Donald Trump: (49:33)
So, we’re doing that. Great question. We’re increasing capacities-
--
Donald Trump: (49:37)
Right. We’re actually adding on through the Army Corps of Engineers. This is a big job and we’re doing it in many states, not just New York and California. By the way, Gavin Newsom’s been terrific. I have to tell you, the Governor of California, we’re getting along really well. We’re working hard for him. As you know, the other hospital ship, and they are incredible. That just arrived in Los Angeles, fully stocked. But Gavin Newsom has been-
--
Donald Trump: (50:03)
In Los Angeles, fully stocked. But Gavin Newsom has been really good, and so many of the governors have been good, and these are governors that I’ve been fighting with about different things for a long time. The forest fires in his case, and the border, and all sorts of things. And here we are getting along very well. And I appreciate his nice words. I really do. I really appreciate it. And the people with me appreciate it. Do you have another question?
--
Donald Trump: (50:32)
Yeah. Good question.
--
Donald Trump: (50:37)
I mean, look, we just started this, we were just notified. And some of the governors have asked us to build hospitals through extensions, through portable hospitals, through things. And normally, in all fairness, this is done normally through local government. We don’t go into cities and expand a hospital that’s existing, but we’re doing it now, because we really are equipped to do it. We have incredible people, and where expanding hospitals, we’re building many portable hospitals. Not only Javits Center, where you have four, plus you have four medical centers, but we’re doing it in New Jersey. Governor Murphy. We’re doing it in other states. We’re doing it in California. We’re doing some in the state of Washington, despite the fact that I’m not appreciative of the way the governor speaks. We’re doing it in a lot of different locations, and we’re doing a lot of expansions. We’re also taking over buildings, and the city will go in, or the state usually will go in, take over a building, and we go in and equip it and make it so that it’s now hospital functioning. They call it hospital functioning. We’re doing a lot of that. Again, this is normally done by governors, and then give it to the city to do it. You know, you bring it into the point, but we’re doing a lot of that, and they’re doing a great job, mostly done by the Army Corps of Engineers, and FEMA.
--
Donald Trump: (52:07)
That I don’t know.
--
Donald Trump: (52:10)
Yeah. Well they say I had classified briefings a long time ago, which wasn’t true. But we’ve had briefings, and as I know it, the governors have also had many briefings by-
--
Donald Trump: (52:25)
I think we knew for a while, but if you take a look, I was the first one to say to China, and I have great respect for China, I will tell you that. But I was the first one when they had the problem, to say you can’t come in. And if you go back, that’s a long time ago. Jon, please?
--
Donald Trump: (52:47)
Here’s what we’re going to have. Are you ready? We’re going to have more than, we’re manufacturing a lot of them now, we’re accumulating a lot. We’re taking a lot, through the act, we’re taking a lot. We’re actually taking them. And we’re going to have in a very short period of time, and Peter’s doing it along with some very talented people, some really talented people. It’s very impressive actually, but we’re actually taking a lot. We’re going to have plenty. And if for some reason, Jon, if for some reason you’re going to need even more, we’re going to be prepared.
--
Donald Trump: (53:17)
As an example, we’ve given out thousands and thousands, which I think you’ll know. We accumulated thousands. We give them out. But we right now, I think in the stockpile, we have over 10,000. The reason we don’t want to distribute that is for exactly what you’re saying. If there’s a mad rush in New York, or maybe in Louisiana, or maybe someplace else, we don’t want to have given out all of those units, the ventilators, and then in those sections we give them to Iowa, but they didn’t have a problem in Iowa. We give them to Idaho. We give them to lots of different places, and now we have to try and get them back, which is never easy to do.
--
Donald Trump: (53:52)
No Jon, what I’m saying is this, we are prepared for things that nobody has any idea that we’d be prepared. And you know what? When I took this over, it was an empty box. We didn’t have testing, we didn’t have anything. We had a broken system there. We had a broken system with stockpiling, we had a lot of broken systems. And I’m not just blaming President Obama, you go long before that, but in all fairness, all of the former presidents, none of them ever thought a thing like this could happen. But we have right now, 10,000 ventilators in stockpile. We are ready to go with those ventilators.
--
Donald Trump: (54:29)
What we don’t want is where we distribute the ventilators like we did in New York, and they didn’t need them, or they didn’t know, or they didn’t use them. If we need them in New York, we’re going to have plenty. Now, we’re getting a lot of ventilators in the next short period of time. A lot of ventilators are coming in the next short period of time. We’re manufacturing. We went to all of the companies, I read their names, we went to all of those companies. They are going to go, I would say ’round the clock, Peter, is that right? They’re going round the clock.
--
Donald Trump: (55:02)
Let’s put it this way. Let’s put it this way. We’ve distributed thousands and thousands already. Normally these would be bought by states, just so you understand. Normally these would be bought by governors. They were… I don’t want to say unprepared, but nobody was prepared for this. What we’ve done, nobody can even imagine. And by the way I’ve had governors tell me, including Democrat governors, they said, “We can’t believe you’ve been able to do this.” And you go to other countries, and we’re not only competing against states, because we don’t want to compete against states. We’ve had a couple of cases where states were buying, we were buying, and I said specifically, because I heard about it. Pull back. Let the state buy it. Immediately, the price goes way down, and they end up buying it. But we’re also competing against many countries, because many countries need the ventilators. That’s why I want to build more if possible. Jon, maybe we’ll take one more question.
--
Donald Trump: (56:02)
So here’s what I’ll tell you. I think we’re in really good shape. This is a pandemic, the likes of which nobody’s seen before. I think we’re in great shape. I think that number one, we’ve distributed… ventilators are a big deal. We’ve distributed vast numbers of ventilators, and we’re prepared to do vast numbers. I think we’re in great shape. I hope that’s the case. I hope that we’re going to have leftovers, so we can help other people, other countries.
--
Donald Trump: (56:31)
Look, look. Don’t be a cutie pie. Okay? Everyone who needs one.
--
Donald Trump: (56:35)
Nobody’s ever done what we’ve done. Nobody’s done anything like we’ve been able to do. And everything I took over was a mess. It was a broken country in so many ways, in so many ways other than this. We had a bad testing system. We had a bad stockpile system, we had nothing in the stockpile system. So I wouldn’t tell me what you’re, you know, like being a wise guy. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (57:12)
There may be something where we’re going to have to help states, because the states have been hurt very badly. And the beautiful thing about our country is, 6.2 trillion, because it is 2.2 plus four, it’s 6.2 trillion dollars, and we can handle that easily, because of who we are, what we are. It’s our money, it’s our… we are the ones. It’s our currency. We can handle it, and we can handle… I watched Jerome Powell the other day, and he did a good job. He said, we’ll do whatever we have to do. Jon, we have to do whatever we have to do.
--
Donald Trump: (57:55)
The priority is life, and safety, and then the economy. Life, and safety.
--
Donald Trump: (58:06)
We’ll see. No, no, no, we’ll see. A lot of things can-
--
Donald Trump: (58:10)
I tell them, if it’s your life, then it’s your safety, and if we need more time, they’re not going to have a problem waiting it out. It’s life, it’s safety, and it’s our country, but we have to take care of people. At the same time, we want to get them out. They want to get out. Our country was built on that, but we have to make sure it’s safe, and everyone knows that. Okay. One more question, please.
--
Donald Trump: (58:55)
So Hydroxychloroquine, which is supposed to be the better of the two seems to have some good backing. We’re going to see. Look, Governor Cuomo, we’ve given him 10,000 units. It’s a lot. And they’re testing it. It’s a malaria drug. It’s also a drug for arthritis, and it’s phenomenal for those two things, as you probably know, especially for malaria. But we’re going to find out soon. I hope it works. There are signs that it could be doing well, they are testing 10,000 units. It’s a lot. And I tell you what, I want to thank the FDA, because they approved it immediately, based on the fact that it was already out for a different purpose. They approved it immediately. So look, Hydroxychloroquine is a very powerful drug for certain things. And it’s a very successful drug. There’s reason to believe that it could be successful here. Now, the reason I disagree with you, and I think Tony would disagree with me, but the reason I disagree with you is that we have a pandemic.
--
Donald Trump: (01:00:02)
We have people dying now. If we’re going to go into labs and test all of this for a long time, we can test it on people right now, who are in serious trouble, who are dying. If it works, we’ve done a great thing. If it doesn’t work, we tried. But this is not something that’s going to kill people. So we can go in, and we can test, and we can take our time. When I was with the FDA, they indicated that, “Well, we’ll start working on it right away, and it could take a year.” I said, “What do you mean a year? We have to have it tonight. If we don’t have it tonight, I want to test it immediately. Because it’s on the market in a different form.” So we know that. So from a safety standpoint, at least we know that, but you’re talking about giving it to people, who in many cases are dying. So we want to do it the way… this is sort of like Right-To-Try. We got Right-To-Try approved.
--
Donald Trump: (01:00:56)
Jon, for 44 years or more, they couldn’t get it approved. We have the best labs, the best doctors. They couldn’t get it… I got it approved. Now, if somebody’s terminally I’ll, and if we think we have something that’s going to work, we can actually use it. They can use it, and I’ll tell you what you ought to do when this is over. You’ve got to do a story on that, because we have had some tremendous results.
--
Donald Trump: (01:01:27)
It’s not even talked to me about, just more fake news Jon. Look, not even talked to me. They’re talking about… the only one I’ve heard that from, like as an example, China pays 25% interest on $250 billion worth of product that they send in. That’s a lot. Everybody keeps saying, “Oh, are you going to suspend the tariffs?” Well, the answer’s no, but President Xi never even brought it up last night, it wasn’t even discussed. It’s fake news. Tell the Wall Street Journal. The Wall Street Journal does a lot of fake news too. It’s pretty amazing.
--
Donald Trump: (01:01:59)
So I want to leave you by just saying, I want to thank you for being here. I want to thank the American public, and all of the people that have helped so much, and we’re going to give the podium to vice president Pence, who has been incredible, and if he’s tired, and if he’s not answering questions like he should, we have a great reason, because he hasn’t slept in about four weeks. But I want to thank him, because he has dedicated, I mean he is a dedicated person long before this, but the job he’s done has been fantastic. So I want to thank Mike, all the people on the task force, and FEMA, and Army Corps, everybody. You’ve been fantastic. Thank you all very much.
Donald Trump: (00:00)
Appreciate you being here. Yesterday I announced that we would be extending our social distance guidelines through the end of April. This is based on modeling that show us the peak in fatalities will not arrive for another two weeks. The same modeling also shows that by very vigorously following these guidelines, we could save more than 1 million American lives. Think of that, 1 million American lives. Our future is in our own hands and the choices and sacrifices we make will determine the fate of this virus and really the fate of our victory. We will have a great victory. We have no other choice. Every one of us has a role to play in winning this war. Every citizen, family, and business can make the difference in stopping the virus. This is our shared patriotic duty. Challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days and this is a very vital 30 days. We’re sort of putting it all on the line, this 30 days so important because we have to get back.
--
Donald Trump: (01:10)
But the more we dedicate ourselves today, the more quickly we will emerge on the other side of the crisis. And that’s the time we’re waiting for. The more we commit ourselves now, the sooner we can win the fight and return to our lives and they will be great lives. Maybe better than ever. Today we reached a historic milestone in our war against the coronavirus. Over 1 million Americans have now been tested, more than any other country by far, not even close and tested accurately. And I think what I’d like to do is ask Secretary Azar, who’s done a fantastic job to come up and just say a few words about the fact that we reached substantially now, more than 1 million tests. Please. Thank you Alex.
--
Donald Trump: (04:38)
Thank you very much. Thank you. I’d like to ask Dr. Hahn come up FTA because we have some really good stuff. First of all, the numbers have been incredible on testing, but in the days ahead we’re going to go even faster and we have something from Abbott Labs which is right here and that’s a five minute test, highly accurate. I maybe can show that as we listen to our FDA commissioner, the job he’s done in the approval process. We talked about the chloroquine and the hydroxychloroquine just now. I thought that I’d mentioned it but Alex has already done that, but we have that now under test with 1,100 people in New York and it was only the fast approval by FDA that allowed us to do that. It was a really rapid approval. And Dr., please say a few words. This is the first one on the line of the five minute test from Abbott.
--
Donald Trump: (07:41)
Great job. Really great job. Thank you, Steve. So the pharmaceutical company [inaudible 00:00:07:52], has been working with us very closely. And as Alex mentioned, a little bit, 30 million doses of the hydroxychloroquine to the United States government. It’s been given. And Bayer has donated 1 million doses of the chloroquine, which will soon be distributed to states and state health officials around the country. Teva Pharmaceuticals is also donating 6 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to US hospitals. 6 million doses. So the private sector as you’d say, Steve, it’s been amazing what’s happened. Really amazing. And we’re going to introduce you to some of the greatest business executives in the world today, no matter where you go. And they’re going to say a little bit about what they’re doing. And then we have so many more.
--
Donald Trump: (08:47)
The FDA has also authorized the materials, N95 respirator mask sterilization kits. It’s an incredible thing. I’ve been asking why are we throwing these masks away? You look at some of these masks and they’re significant pieces of equipment that I say, how come you throw them away? Why aren’t they using sterilization techniques? And I got a call from Mike DeWine, the governor of Ohio. And he’s a tremendous guy, tremendous governor. And he said, we have a company named [inaudible 00:09:24] and they’re having a hard time getting approval from the FDA. And I called up Dr. Hahn and within a very short period of time, they got the approval. Steve, we really appreciate it. I want to thank Mike and I want to thank Steve. And they’re going to be able, each machine now, can disinfect 120,000 masks per day. Now think of that. Each machine can disinfect 120,000 masks per day. It’ll be just like a new one. It could go up to about 20 times for each mask.
--
Donald Trump: (09:58)
Each mask can go through this process 20 times. They have two in Ohio, one in New York, and one will soon be shipped to Seattle, Washington, and also to Washington D.C. So that’s going to make a tremendous difference on the masks. This morning I spoke to our nation’s governors to help each state get the medical supplies they need. Yesterday, Vice President Mike Pence asked our nation’s hospitals to begin reporting total bed capacity, ICU bed capacity, ventilator capacity, and vital medical supply levels on a daily basis. And Mike, thank you for the great job. Thank you very much.
--
Donald Trump: (10:40)
In New York, the 2,900 bed hospital under construction, which is now completed. They completed it in three days. You might say three and a half days, at the Javits Center, will be completed today. When you look … So they’re going up, I think we’re going to be adding some more beds which will be completed today. We’ve opened up … Whoops, there goes our box and my hair’s blowing around and it’s mine. The one thing you can’t get away with if it’s not yours you got a problem if you’re President. A nearly 3000 medical beds will become operational. The US Navy ship Comfort also arrived today equipped with 12 operating rooms and 1000 hospital beds. Work has begun on additional temporary hospital sites including a 600 bed capacity nursing home facility in Brooklyn and numerous floors of a high rise building on Wall Street. It’s been really a pretty amazing what they’ve done, the Army Corps of Engineers, what they’ve done.
--
Donald Trump: (11:46)
They just completed, think of it, a 2,900 bed hospital in New York in just about three days, maybe four days. And the whole city’s talking about it. On top of that, we floated in a great ship, which is going to be a thousand rooms, which is being used for patients outside of what we’re focused on and that will free up a lot of rooms for what we’re focused on. So it’s been great. The Army Corps of Engineers is awarded contracts for the construction of alternate care facilities also. At the State University at Stony Brook, State University Old Westbury and the Westchester Community Center, we’re sending 60 ambulances to New York City today. We have a total of 60 we’re getting some additional ones with up to 190 more to follow at different locations.
--
Donald Trump: (12:46)
To date, FEMA has obligated more than $1.3 billion dollars in federal support to the state of New York. We’re spending a lot of money in New York. It’s a hotbed, there’s no question about it. And we’re spending a lot of time, effort on New York, New Jersey. Spoke with governor Cuomo a lot, spoke with governor Murphy a lot in New Jersey, and we’re really getting the job done. People are very impressed and I’m very impressed by the people in FEMA, the people in the Army Corps of Engineers, because what they’ve done, I’ve never seen anybody doing anything like it.
--
Donald Trump: (13:26)
In addition to the 8,100 ventilators that we’ve already delivered, over the next 48 hours, we’re delivering more than 1000. 400 ventilators are going to Michigan very shortly. 300 going to New Jersey, 150 ventilators to Illinois, 150 to Louisiana and 50 to Connecticut. FEMA and HHS already delivered 11.6 million N95 respirators, 26 million surgical masks, 5.3 million face shields, 4.4 million surgical gowns and 22 million gloves. And I don’t know if you just saw, it just came over the wires that Ford just announced, just a little while ago, that they will produce along with General Electric Healthcare, 50,000 ventilators, and they’re going to be doing it in less than 100 days.
--
Donald Trump: (14:24)
And top of that, we have other companies that are doing ventilators, including General Motors, but we have a nine other companies doing ventilators. As we outpace what we need, we’re going to be sending them to Italy, we’re going to be sending them to France. We’re going to be sending them to Spain, where they have tremendous problems and other countries as we can. But the fact that we’re doing so many so quickly is a tribute to our great companies. More than 14,000 National Guard members have been activated and can help supplement state and local…
--
Donald Trump: (15:03)
… Have been activated and can help supplement state and local efforts to distribute personal protective equipment where we’re sending a lot. We have plane loads coming in. We have 51 loads from various locations all around the world and they’re landing. We had our first big cargo plane land this morning and we’re getting it from all over the world and we’re also sending things that we don’t need to other parts. I just spoke to the Prime Minister of Italy and we have additional capacity. We have additional product that we don’t need. We’re going to be sending approximately a hundred million dollars worth of things, of surgical and medical and hospital things to Italy and Giuseppe was very, very happy. I will tell you that they haven’t a very hard time.
--
Donald Trump: (15:55)
Joining us this afternoon are CEOs of the great American companies that are fulfilling their patriotic duty by producing or donating medical equipment to help meet our most urgent needs. What they’re doing is incredible and these are great companies. Darius Adamczyk of Honeywell, you know that, and Darius has been somebody that I’ve dealt with in the past and he’s a great leader of a great company.
--
Donald Trump: (16:23)
Debra Waller of Jockey International. A friend of mine, Mike Lindell of MyPillow. Boy, do you sell those pillows? That’s unbelievable what you do. David Taylor of Procter and Gamble and Greg Hayes of United Technologies Corporation and I just want to tell all of you that America’s very grateful to you and what you’ve done. Amazing job you’ve done and we thank you very much.
--
Donald Trump: (16:49)
I’d like you to come up and say a couple of words if you might about your companies. Mike, come on up. Come on up fellas. Please come on up. You have to say what you’re doing because it’s been really incredible. Go ahead, Mike.
--
Donald Trump: (19:19)
Thank you, Mike. Please come on up. I did not know he was going to do that but he’s a friend of mine and I do appreciate it. Thank you, Mike, very much. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (21:15)
Fantastic. Thank you. Normally I’d shake his hand but we’re not supposed to do that anymore. So that’s okay. Great job. Thank you to Honeywell. Please, go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (23:14)
Thank you very much.
--
Donald Trump: (24:49)
Thank you.
--
Donald Trump: (26:40)
Thank you very much. Thank you. Fantastic. Great company.
--
Donald Trump: (26:43)
Those a great companies. Thank you very much. I’d like to ask Seema to come up and say a few words about what you’re doing and what’s happening and how positive it’s been. I really appreciate it. Come on up, Seema Verma.
--
Donald Trump: (31:40)
Thank you very much. You were fantastic [inaudible 00:31:42], and you’re doing a great job. So we are in the midst of something that is very difficult but we are going to win. It’s just a question of when. We want to do it as quickly as possible. We want to have as few deaths as possible and we will meet again tomorrow for some statistics and some updates as to where we are, where we think we’re going, and timing. I think timing is going to be very important because we have to get our country back. We have to get our country back to where it was and maybe beyond where it was because we’ve learned so much, but we will have lost a lot of people and in many ways they hear us.
--
Donald Trump: (32:26)
And if you look at what’s happening with our medical professionals, it’s a danger there. They’re warriors. Men and women are doing a job the likes of which I don’t think anyone’s ever seen. I see them coming out of planes today going into New York, going into the most dangerous locations, dangerous areas. And they go in there and they just want to do the job. And you see the numbers, you see the numbers, I see the numbers. I have some friends that are unbelievably sick. We thought they were going in for a mild stay and in one case, he’s unconscious in a coma. And you say, how did that happen?
--
Donald Trump: (33:08)
So I just want to thank all of the great professionals, men and women, doctors and nurses and paramedics and fast responders and law enforcement. By the way, if you look at New York and you see the effect that this had on law enforcement, it’s been incredible. These are great people, firefighters, great people. They’re helping in so many different ways. So thank you very much. And if you’d like, we’ll take a few questions. John, please.
--
Donald Trump: (34:08)
They’ll be staying, and we may add a few more, but the guidelines will be very much as they are, maybe even toughened up a little bit, but they’re having a big impact. They are having a tremendous impact and we’re starting to see it. And that’s the key, we’re starting to see the impact that they’re having.
--
Donald Trump: (34:44)
Well, I think that some are ramping up to a level that they’re not going to have to, John, and I think that we also have kept in reserve. We have almost 10,000 ventilators in our line. We’ve held back just because we did the stockpile, we didn’t want to give them because we don’t know where the emergency… it hits so fast. It comes so quickly, and we have 10,000. We’re probably going to send some of them now. We’ve been sending a lot to Michigan and various other states. We’ll probably send some additional ones to Michigan. New York’s been doing very well, but we can add some more to New York. We’re adding them to the areas that are having a problem.
--
Donald Trump: (35:23)
Even Alabama, all of a sudden a flared up a little bit as you saw over the last couple of days and we’ll send them down to Alabama. So we have 10,000, we kept them for this very specific purpose. It sounds like a lot, but it’s not when you think about it, but we’re making a lot and when you see, we’re talking about hundreds of thousands being made in a very short period of time because if you look at what just… so we have now 10 companies at least making the ventilators. And we say go ahead because honestly, other countries really, they’ll never be able to do it. It’s a complex piece of equipment and it’s big and expensive.
--
Donald Trump: (36:05)
Yes. I do think so. I think we’re going to be in very good shape, and we had a great call today with the governors and they were, I actually said, “I hope that the media is listening to this call,” because it was a really good call and that was randomly selected largely Democrats and Republicans in there. I think for the most part they were saying thank you for doing a great job and we discussed that at the end of the call. So really, people are very happy with what we’re doing. Now the circumstances are so terrible because of what’s going on, but I think they’re very impressed by the Federal government.
--
Donald Trump: (36:45)
I watched that beautiful ship floating in today into, weeks ahead of schedule, almost four weeks ahead of schedule into New York Harbor, Comfort. And I watched the Mercy floating in to Los Angeles a week ago, almost a week ago. And they are stocked. They are really ready to go. They’re stocked with both talent and tremendous amounts of equipment and the Navy and everybody else involved, they got it ready so fast. It’s just incredible what they can do. They’ve geared up. That’s why I mean, I am so impressed by the people involved. Mike and I were talking about it before, the level of genius to put it all together so quickly. A month ago nobody ever heard of this. Nobody had any idea that Mercy was being maintained.
--
Donald Trump: (37:33)
It was in maintenance for a month. And when they heard we needed it, and I was surprised, they said, “Sir, we’re ready to go.” I said, “What do you mean? You’re not going to be ready for three weeks?” “No sir, we’re all ready to go.” It was incredible. And we’ve had many instances like this. I think the building of the hospital, 2,900 beds in a matter of days, a few days is just incredible. Governor Cuomo was impressed and Gavin Newsome was impressed by what we’ve been doing with Gavin in California in Los Angeles area in particular, but really San Francisco, all over, all over California. When you look at what we’re doing with Michigan, we’re getting along very well with Michigan’s, great place. We’re sending a lot of things to Michigan because that’s becoming a hotbed, especially a specific area as you know, it’s become very hot.
--
Donald Trump: (38:24)
It’s become, I don’t know, could even at some point supersede, but it’s got to be taken care of. So the relationship we have with the governors, I just wish you could… because we took a lot of calls from a lot of different states and I wish you could have heard, even a thing where the governor of Ohio calls where he has a company that does the sterilization, but they have a problem because it’s not going quickly at the FDA. And I call up Steve and Steve comes and he said, “We’ll get it done.” And they checked it and they got it done almost immediately. And originally they were approving it for 10,000 masks and then it was supposed to be for 80 and they ultimately approved it for 120,000. I mean, it’s a tremendous number.
--
Donald Trump: (39:10)
And I kept wondering, why aren’t they sterilizing these masks? I assumed maybe you couldn’t do it, but then I’d look at them and they’d look like it’s not cloth. It’s something that looks like it could be sterilized and that’s what they’ve done and that’s the machine that is over there actually. They have a piece of the machine over there. I won’t bother showing it to you. And this is incredible when you talk about five minutes, 15 minutes and highly accurate and not nearly as disturbing to do as the other tests. So we’ve just gotten better. We’re doing things that nobody else ever thought of. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (40:03)
Well, we’re letting the governors do in their states pretty much what they want with our supervision and they consult with us in all cases. Some go further than others as you know. I mean, I could give you plenty of examples, but I’m not going to do that because we never want to be controversial, but some of the governors have taken it a step further-
--
Donald Trump: (40:26)
… and people are questioning that, but look, staying at home with respect to what we’re talking about doesn’t bother me at all. People should be staying at home. That’s what we want. [inaudible 00:40:35] please. [inaudible 00:40:37].
--
Donald Trump: (41:12)
Well, I think what we’re doing is we’re trying to, as a group, governors and that’s Republicans and Democrats, we’re just working together to solve this problem. What you’re mentioning has been going on for a long time and it’s a sad event, a lot of sad events in this country, but what we’re doing is now we’re working on the virus, we’re working on that hidden enemy and I think we’re doing a great job on, as good a job as you can possibly do. When when Tony and Deborah came up with numbers yesterday to say that if we did nothing, you could lose 2.2, up to 2., maybe beyond, I don’t know, maybe beyond, but 2.2 million people if we did nothing. And I can’t tell you what the unfortunate final toll is going to be, but it’s going to be a very small fraction of that.
--
Donald Trump: (42:01)
So we’re doing an awfully good job I think with what we’re doing. Please go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (42:06)
Please.
--
Donald Trump: (42:21)
Well, we’ve talked about it. Obviously there are some parts of the country that are in far deeper trouble than others. There are other parts that frankly are not in trouble at all. So hopefully, we’re going to be able to keep it that way by doing what we’re doing. So we talked about quarantine as you know, the other day a group came to me and they wanted to do the quarantine and I said, “Let’s think about it.” And we did it, we studied it. And by the time the evening came, it just was something that was very unwieldy, very tough to enforce and something we didn’t want to do. But we did advisory. And I think that’s doing well. I mean, I look at the streets, you look at New York where there’s… I looked down Fifth Avenue today, they were showing a shot of Fifth Avenue in Primetime and there was almost nobody on Fifth Avenue.
--
Donald Trump: (43:09)
I’ve never seen that before. There was no car, there was no anything. So I think the people of this country have done an incredible job. If we do that, we will let you know. But it’s pretty unlikely I would think at this time.
--
Donald Trump: (43:23)
Yes.
--
Donald Trump: (43:46)
Please come.
--
Donald Trump: (44:55)
Thank you very much. Thanks. It is amazing. You look at Louisiana and for a long time it was just staying at-
--
Donald Trump: (45:03)
For a long time, it was just staying at nothing. And then all of a sudden, I look one day and I see a lot and a lot and a lot, and then it explodes. And now, we’re working very carefully and very powerfully with them. We’re building hospitals, we’re building a lot of different things for Louisiana. So, it’s very important. Yeah, please go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (45:44)
Yeah. We’re prepared, I hope it doesn’t happen. Doctor, would you like to say something about that? I hope it doesn’t happen, but we’re certainly prepared.
--
Donald Trump: (47:02)
Okay. Please, go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (47:12)
Yeah, very interesting, I saw it.
--
Donald Trump: (47:23)
Well, we haven’t discussed it to that extent, but it’s certainly something we could discuss. We’re getting certainly the number of masks that you need. We are in the process of talking about things… I saw his suggestion on that, so we’ll take a look at it. For a period of time, not forever. I mean, we want our country back. We’re not going to be wearing masks forever, but it could be for a short period of time after we get back into gear. People could… I could see something like that happening for a period of time. But I would hope it would be a very limited period of time, doctors. They’ll come back and say, for the rest of our lives we have to wear masks.
--
Donald Trump: (48:14)
Well, the GPS, that’s the very severe idea. I’ve been hearing about it, GPS. So, what happens? A siren goes off if you get too close to somebody. That’s pretty severe. But he’s somebody who was with me for a long time. He worked… They did a great job at FDA. So, we’re going to take a look. I just received it a little while ago, he sent it over. So very good. Go ahead. Let’s give it a shot.
--
Donald Trump: (48:44)
Here we go.
--
Donald Trump: (49:08)
[crosstalk 00:00:49:06], it will go away. And I do want them to stay calm. And we are doing a great job. If you look at those individual statements, they’re all true. Stay calm, it will go away. You know it is going away and it will go away, and we’re going to have a great victory. And it’s people like you and CNN that say things like that, that… It’s why people just don’t want to listen to CNN anymore. You could ask a normal question. The statements I made are, I want to keep the country calm, I don’t want panic in the country. I could cause panic much better than even you. I could do much… I would make you look like a minor league player. But you know what? I don’t want to do that. I want to have our country be calm and strong and fight and win. And it will go away.
--
Donald Trump: (49:50)
And it is incredible the job that all of these people are doing, putting them all together, the job that they’re doing. I am very proud of the job they’re doing, that Mike Pence is doing, that the task force has done, that Honeywell and Procter & Gamble and Mike and all of these people have done. I’m very proud. It’s almost a miracle. And it is, the way it’s all come together. And instead of asking a nasty, snarky question like that, you should ask a real question. And other than that, I’m going to go to somebody else. Please, go ahead. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (50:33)
Well, I expressed what was told to me by a tremendous power in the business. He said that at a New York hospital, for a long period of time, he was giving 10,000, maybe maximum 20,000 masks, over a short time. And all of a sudden, he’s giving 300,000. And I said, “No matter how bad this is, could that be possible?” He said, “No.” So there’s only a couple of that could happen. Is it going out the back door? And I’ve reported it to the city, and let the city take a look at it. But when you go from 10,000 masks to 300,000 masks, Mike, over the same period of time, there’s something going on. Now, I’m not making any charges, but when everyone’s looking for masks… And by the way, that’s another thing, we’re making a lot of masks and the sterilization process is going to save a lot of time and a lot of masks.
--
Donald Trump: (51:26)
But, when you have the biggest distributor of product that distributes to many of the big hospitals and hospital chains, and he brings up a statistic like that… And I know you’re trying to make a big deal out of it, but you shouldn’t be. You should actually go over to the hospital and find out why. You shouldn’t be asking me. I’m just saying, that’s the way it is.
--
Donald Trump: (51:47)
You should go over there as a great reporter. I have no idea who you are, but that’s okay. You should go over there. Go to the hospital and find out, how come you used to get 10,000 masks and you had a full hospital? New York City always full. And how come now you have 300,000 masks? Despite the virus and all, you have three… How do you go from 10 to 300,000? And this is very serious stuff. I mean, I could see from 10 to 20 or from 10 to 40 or 50 or something, but how do you go from 10 to 300,000 masks? So what I think you should do as a… I’m sure you’re a wonderful investigative reporter, you should go to the hospital and find out why.
--
Donald Trump: (52:28)
Steve, please.
--
Donald Trump: (52:34)
Well, it’s so bad for the economy. But the economy is number two on my list. First, I want to save a lot of lives. We’re going to get the economy back. I think the economy is going to come back very fast. Steve is just asking about the economy, what’s it like? We basically shut down our country. And we did that in order to keep people separated, keep people apart. They’re not working in offices, they’re not in airplanes together. We’ve really shut it down. And 150/151 other countries are pretty much shut down. But here with the… We have the greatest economy in the world. We have the greatest economy in the history of our country. And I had to go from doing a great job for three years, to shutting it down. But you know what? We’re going to build it up and we’re going to build it up rapidly. And I think in the end, we’ll be stronger for it. We learned a lot.
--
Donald Trump: (53:26)
And I have to say, we’ve had great relationships with a lot of countries. China sent us some stuff which was terrific. Russia sent us a very large plane load of things, medical equipment, which was very nice. Other countries sent us things that I was very surprised at. Very happily surprised. We learned a lot. We’re learning a lot. And we’re also learning, that the concept of borders is very important, Steve. It’s very important. Having borders is very important. But, we have done an incredible job. The economy is going to come back. My focus is saving lives. That’s the only focus I could have. We’re going to bring the economy back and we’ll bring it back fast. Yeah, please.
--
Donald Trump: (54:14)
Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (54:14)
Please.
--
Donald Trump: (54:39)
Yeah. Well, it’s very much on par. Look-
--
Donald Trump: (54:43)
Per capita. We have areas of country that’s very wide. I know South Korea better than anybody, it’s a very tight… You know how many people are in Seoul? You know how big the city of Seoul is?
--
Donald Trump: (54:53)
38 million people. That’s bigger than anything we have. 38 million people all tightly wound together. We have vast farmlands. We have vast areas where they don’t have much of a problem. In some cases, they have no problem whatsoever. We have done more tests. Well, I didn’t talk about per capita. We have done more tests by far than any country in the world, by far. Our testing is also better than any country in the world. And when you looking at that, as simple as that looks, that’s something that’s a game changer. And every country wants that, every country. So, rather than asking a question like that, you should congratulate the people that have done this testing. Because, we inherited this administration, inherited a broken system, a system that was obsolete, a system that didn’t work. It was okay for a tiny small group of people. But, once you got beyond that, it didn’t work. We have built an incredible system to the fact, where we have now done more tests than any other country in the world. And now the technology is really booming.
--
Donald Trump: (55:56)
I just spoke to… Well, I spoke to a lot… I’m not going to even mention. I spoke to a number of different testing companies today. And the job that they’ve done and the job that they’re doing, is incredible. But when Abbott comes out and does this so quickly, it’s really unreal. In fact, one company, I have to say, that stands out in the job, and I think I can say this, I don’t want to insult anybody else, but Roche. Roche, is been incredible in the testing job they’ve done. And they’re ramping it up exponentially, it’s up. And you should be saying, congratulations, instead of asking a really snarky question, because I know exactly what you mean by that.
--
Donald Trump: (56:41)
You should be saying, congratulations to the men and women who have done this job, who have inherited a broken testing system and who have made it great. And if you don’t say it, I’ll say it. I want to congratulate all of the people, you have done a fantastic job. And we will see you all tomorrow, thank you very much. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (00:00)
With Kevin McCarthy, future speaker of the house, I hope. And he’s done a fantastic job for the people of California. And also the people of California have done a fantastic job, when you take a look at the bump, and how they’re doing out there. I congratulate everybody out there, but I thought I’d have Kevin say a few words. So Kevin, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:20)
Great job you’re doing. Thank you.
--
Donald Trump: (01:22)
You go ahead. I’ll talk to you later.
--
Donald Trump: (01:28)
Okay. Thank you very much everybody. And I want to start by saying that our hearts go out to the people of New York as they bear the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic in America. That seems to be the hotspot right now. But you have some others as you know, that are very bad, very bad. Louisiana is getting hit very hard. Parts of Michigan are getting hit very, very hard. New Jersey is surprisingly, it’s much greater than anybody would have thought. They’re doing a really good job. Governor is doing a really good job out there.
--
Donald Trump: (02:03)
New York’s first responders, EMTs, doctors, nurses are showing incredible courage under pressure. They’re the best in the world. We will take every action and we’ll spare no resource, financial, medical, scientific, we will not spare anything. We’ll get it back into shape. The Empire State, the governor’s doing an excellent job. They’re all working very hard together. At the request of the Governor, as you know, the Javits Center… We have 2,500 beds and we’re going to allow that to be a system where this horrible disease can be looked after. The patients can be looked after. That was going to be for regular medical problems such as accidents. It’s very interesting, the Governor is telling me, “We don’t have too many accidents, very few people driving.” So we’re going to put that facility into play, which is a big facility. The ship will be staying the way it is, but we’re putting that facility into play to help them.
--
Donald Trump: (03:12)
And today also the CDC is announcing additional steps Americans can take to defend against the transmission of the virus. From recent studies we know that the transmission from individuals without symptoms is playing a more significant role in the spread of the virus than previously understood. So, you don’t seem to have symptoms and it still gets transferred. In light of these studies, the CDC is advising the use of nonmedical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure. So it’s voluntary, you don’t have to do. They suggested for a period of time, but this is voluntary.
--
Donald Trump: (03:55)
I don’t think I’m going to be doing it, but you have a lot of ways you can look at it as follows. The CDC is recommending that Americans wear a basic cloth or fabric mask that can be either purchased online or simply made at home, probably material that you’d have at home. These face coverings can be easily washed or reused. I want to emphasize that the CDC is not recommending the use of medical grade or surgical grade masks, and we want that to be used for our great medical people that are working so hard and doing some job. Medical protective gear must be reserved for the frontline healthcare workers who are performing those vital services. The new mask guidelines also do not replace CDC’s guidance on social distancing, including staying in your home when possible, standing at least six feet apart for a period of time. Again, we’re going to all come back together here. We’re going all come back together. And, practicing hand hygiene, which we should do anyway.
--
Donald Trump: (04:59)
A lot of things I think are going to spill over. Shaking hands, maybe, will stay with our country for a long time beyond this. One of our great doctors was telling me that, as you know, we have flus every year and the number of people killed by the flu is very substantial. He said that if they didn’t shake hands, that number would be substantially lower. So maybe some of these things, longterm, will be good. But those guidelines are still the best and the safest way to avoid the infection.
--
Donald Trump: (05:36)
So with the masks it’s going to be, really, a voluntary thing. You can do it, you don’t have to do it. I’m choosing not to do it, but some people may want to do it and that’s okay. It may be good, probably will. They’re making a recommendation. It’s only a recommendation, it’s voluntary.
--
Donald Trump: (05:54)
We’ve also taken action to ensure no barrier to any American seeking testing or treatment of the coronavirus. The largest insurer nationwide, the Blue Cross Blue Shield system, has now announced that it will not require any copays, which is really something, that’s a tremendous statement, from patients of the virus treatment for the next 60 days. Similar to the commitments of Cigna, Humana, Anthem. Those are great companies and they’re all doing the same thing. So copays, for them to do that is a big statement. We appreciate it.
--
Donald Trump: (06:33)
Today I can so proudly announce that hospitals and healthcare providers treating uninsured coronavirus patients will be reimbursed by the federal government using funds from the Economic Relief Package congress passed last month. That was as per the question yesterday, and actually the day before yesterday. This should alleviate any concern uninsured Americans may have about seeking the coronavirus treatment. So that, I think, answers the question pretty well and very much in the favor of our great people.
--
Donald Trump: (07:10)
I’m also signing a directive invoking the Defense Production Act to prohibit export of scarce health and medical supplies by unscrupulous actors and profiteers. The Secretary of Homeland Security will work with FEMA to prevent the export of N95 respirators, surgical masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment. We need these items immediately for domestic use, we have to have them. But we’ve done really well with the purchase of items and you’ll be hearing about that shortly.
--
Donald Trump: (07:48)
We’ve already leveraged the DPA to stop the hoarding and price gouging of crucial supplies. Under that authority, this week the Department of Health and Human Services working with the Department of Justice took custody of nearly 200,000 N95 respirators, 130,000 surgical masks, 600,000 gloves. As well as bottles, many, many, many bottles and disinfectant sprays that were being hoarded. All of this material is now being given to healthcare workers, most of it’s already been given out. And we’ve given a lot to New York, a lot to New Jersey, a lot to other places.
--
Donald Trump: (08:29)
In addition, to ensure that health care workers in New York have the protective equipment they need, the federal government in the name of the Department of Defense is providing about 8.1 million N95 respirators, Department of Defense. And we’ve already given 200,000 of them to New York City. Mayor De Blasio needed them very badly, so we got them to Mayor De Blasio in New York City and they were very grateful. 8.1 million, and we’re going to be increasing that number from 8.1 million to more. That’s a lot of N95 respirators.
--
Donald Trump: (09:11)
Today my team spoke with the CEO of Oschner Health and the CEO of LCMC, the two largest health systems in New Orleans. They said they feel that they currently have enough ventilators. I think a lot of people are going to have enough ventilators, and masks, and appreciate what we did and all of the things we’ve been doing with them, working with them. The CEO of Oschner, Warner Thomas, who’s really been fantastic I have to say, indicated a need for 230,000 surgical gowns and I instructed FEMA to deliver them tomorrow. That’s Louisiana, New Orleans. 230,000 surgical gowns, they’ll have them by tomorrow. We’re expanding the role of the armed forces in our response effort because no one is better prepared to win a war than the United States military. And we are in a war, the invisible enemy, remember. Over 9,000 retired Army medical personnel have answered their nation’s call and are now supporting field hospitals and medical facilities all across the country. Like what I just told you, that Governor Cuomo requested we do something in Javits where we’ve taken over. And we’re going to have that manned by the military, because it’s very tough to get more people in the New York area. So we’re going to have it manned by the military, Javits Center.
--
Donald Trump: (10:44)
National Guard members have been activated to help States build new treatment centers and assist in the seamless distribution of medical supplies. That includes National Guard. The National Guard is assisting very strongly because the States were, in many cases, unable to have the delivery capability from warehouses and other places that we put the supplies. So I’ve given approval to use the National Guard, the various National Guards in the different States. And they’re doing a fantastic job of not only protecting people, but delivering material.
--
Donald Trump: (11:23)
The Army Corps of Engineers has assessed more than 100 facilities in all 50 States and is rapidly building temporary hospitals and alternative care sites in many States. In New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, Ohio. They’re doing a lot of work in just those States, plus additionals that will be announced probably tomorrow, but they’re doing some job. The Army Corps of Engineers, what a job they’re doing. And FEMA, what a job they’re doing.
--
Donald Trump: (12:01)
As we deploy the power of our military, we’re also deploying the skill of our doctors, scientists, and medical researchers. We continue to study the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and other therapies in the treatment and prevention of the virus. We will keep the American people fully informed in our findings. Hydroxychloroquine, I don’t know, it’s looking like it’s having some good results. I hope that, that would be a phenomenal thing. But we have it right now in, approximately, it’s increased to 1,500 people. I spoke with Dr. Zucker in New York, terrific guy by the way, he’s doing a good job. And I spoke to Governor Cuomo last evening and this morning about it. It’s been there for about three and a half days and many other places it’s being tested, too. And we have a tremendous supply of it. We’ve ordered it in the case that it works, and it could have some pretty big impacts. We’ll see what happens.
--
Donald Trump: (13:07)
My administration is also working to get relief to American workers and businesses. In day one of the Paycheck Protection Program, as Kevin said, more than $3.5 billion in guaranteed loans have been processed to help small businesses keep their workers employed during this unprecedented time. Bank of America has been incredible. Of the big banks, Bank of America has really stepped forward and done a great job. And then you have the community banks, your smaller banks, and we’re already at three point $5 billion going out to incredible people. But that’s way ahead of schedule.
--
Donald Trump: (13:47)
The SBA and the treasury are working around the clock. And our banking partners are really incredible, and they’re ensuring that the money gets to small businesses as quickly as possible. And then the small business, in turn, take care of employees that they would have had to let go. And now they’ll keep them, and that’s good. Then they’re going to open for business and they’re going to have their employees, and we’ll try and get back to where we were. Eventually, we’re going to supersede where we were.
--
Donald Trump: (14:15)
The energy industry has been especially hard hit in the crisis. This afternoon I met with Greg Garland of Phillips 66, Dave Hagar of Devon Energy, Harold Hamm of Continental Resources, Jeff Hildebrand of Hilcorp Energy, Vicky Hollub of Occidental Petroleum, Mike Sommers of the American Petroleum Institute, Kelcy Warren of Energy Transfer Partners, Mike Wirth of Chevron, and Darren Woods of ExxonMobil. I informed them that we will be making space available in the strategic petroleum reserve to let American producers store surplus oil that can be sold at a later time. There’s a tremendous abundance of oil, primarily because of the virus. The virus has just stopped demand of everything, including oil. So we’re working with our great energy companies. These are great companies. They employee tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people. They’ve kept America really going for a long time, and no big price hikes, no big anything. I mean, they’ve just kept it going and now they got hit. But with all the jobs and all of the good that they do, we’re going to make sure that they stay in good shape.
--
Donald Trump: (15:35)
America is engaged in a historic battle to safeguard the lives of our citizens, our future society. Our greatest weapon is the discipline and determination of every citizen to stay at home and stay healthy for a long time. We want them to stay healthy for a long time, so stay at home. This is ending, this will end. You’ll see some bad things, and then you’re going to see some really good things and it’s not going to be too long.
--
Donald Trump: (16:04)
We will heal our citizens, and we will care for our neighbors, and we will unleash the full might of the United States of America to vanquish the virus. And with that I’d like to ask Mike Pence to come up. Vice-President, say a few words. And we’ll have a couple of other quick talks on a couple of subjects, and we’ll take questions.
--
Donald Trump: (16:26)
It’s a beautiful Friday in Washington, D.C. and our country’s a great place. And we’re getting better, we’re getting better very quickly. This was artificially induced, they said, “Close it down, you have to close it down.” We closed it down and we’re healing, and we’re going to get it better fast. So Mike, if you could come up and say a few words, please.
--
Donald Trump: (29:10)
Okay. Let’s go. Steve?
--
Donald Trump: (29:21)
I just don’t want to wear one myself. It’s a recommendation. They recommend it. I’m feeling good. I just don’t want to be doing, I don’t know, somehow sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk, the great Resolute Desk. I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens. I don’t know, somehow I don’t see it for myself. Maybe I’ll change my mind, but this will pass and hopefully it’ll pass very quickly.
--
Donald Trump: (29:55)
Now, with that being said, if somebody wants to… I mean most people can just make something out of a certain material, so it’s very well designated. It’s very simple to do. I won’t be doing it personally. It’s a recommendation. Okay?
--
Donald Trump: (30:15)
Surgeon General, please.
--
Donald Trump: (34:29)
Okay.
--
Donald Trump: (34:43)
I’d talk to the governors. The governors know what they’re doing, they’ve been doing a great job. I guess we’re close to 90% anyway. The states that we’re talking about are not in jeopardy. No, I would leave it to the governors. I like that from the standpoint of governing and I like that from the standpoint of even our Constitution.
--
Donald Trump: (35:10)
I pointed at you. I heard a different voice, I heard a much different voice. We’ll get you later.
--
Donald Trump: (35:22)
Well, a lot of things came out. It’s a great industry. It’s an important industry. It’s a tremendous job-producing industry and it’s just vital. It was also a very interesting because they all would get the test before they came into the room. You have the head of ExxonMobil, you have all these guys taking the test and they all passed with flying colors. That was good. They left happy in that respect, at least. There’s just an overabundance of oil right now. Oil and gas, tremendous overabundance and it was caused… They were doing a great job. They were producing a lot of energy, but then you had the virus come along and it knocked another 35%, maybe 40%, off of the market. There’s too much oil, there’s a glut, and these are great companies and they’ll figure it out. It’s free market. We’ll figure it out.
--
Donald Trump: (36:16)
They were having a competition. We’ll see how it all works out. I think it’s going to work out very well. It’s going to take a long time to get rid of that. There’s massive excess amount of oil and gas. Massive, like probably there’s never been. Where that does work out well, I guess you could say, is for drivers. I think in certain locations, it’s down to 90 and 95 cents a gallon right now on the road. But we have a tremendous industry, a great industry. It’s tremendously important industry from the standpoint of jobs and we’re energy independent. We have to make sure we keep it that way. All right, please.
--
Donald Trump: (37:10)
Didn’t know anything about that. That was done by the FDA. Very capable people at the FDA.
--
Donald Trump: (37:28)
I don’t blame them, they can push back if they want. We’re not happy with 3M. We’re not happy, and the people that dealt with it directly are not at all happy with 3M. We’ll see whether or not we do. I heard what he had to say today. I don’t know the gentleman, but we’re not happy with 3M. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (37:45)
I don’t know. But every time you asked that question, whenever he’s not here, you look, you say, “Where is he?” And you’ll say, “Is there a problem?” No problem whatsoever. Every time he’s not here. Sometimes I’ll ask him to come because that’s the first question that you and a couple of others from the Fake News Establishment ask is, “Where’s Dr. Fauci?” We’re doing great together. We’re covering a different subject today. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (38:43)
Well, I always knew that pandemics are one of the worst things could happen. There’s been nothing like this since probably 1917, that was the big one in Europe. It started actually here and went to Europe, probably. I’ve heard about… Excuse me. Wait a minute. Let me finish. I’ve heard about this for a long time. Pandemics. You don’t want pandemics. I don’t think he was talking about a specific pandemic, he was talking about the threat of a pandemic could happen and it could happen. Most people thought it wouldn’t, and most people didn’t understand the severity of it. This is very severe. What’s happened is very severe, but I’d let you answer that. I assume that he was talking about the concept of a pandemic.
--
Donald Trump: (40:43)
Previous administrations gave us very little ammunition for the military and very little shelf space. Let me just tell you. You know it. You know the answer. The previous administration, the shelves were empty. The shelves were empty. So what you should do is speak to the people from the previous administration, Jim, and ask them that question because the shelves were empty. You know what else? The military shelves were also empty. We had no ammunition, literally, and that was said by one of your favorite generals. Sir, we have no ammunition. Guess what? We had very little medical supply also. All right. Go ahead. We’ll get it back. We’ll get you back. We’ll get you back, please.
--
Donald Trump: (41:28)
Jim, I said we’ll get you back. Please go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (41:37)
It covers everything.
--
Donald Trump: (41:39)
But if somebody ordered, if Italy, if Spain who has big problems, these are countries with tremendous problems. France, if they ordered, if they have long-term orders and they’re in there and they want to get certain things, I’ve let them go out in certain instances because I think it’s only fair. They have problems that are proportionately or relatively bigger than our problems. So if they ordered something and they’re waiting for, as an example, masks made here and going to Italy, I’m not going to be stopping that. I think it would be very unfair.
--
Donald Trump: (42:09)
By the way, speaking about being fair and unfair, two very big cruise liners, as you know, I allowed them to dock today. We worked with the governor of Florida, as you know, Ron DeSantis, and we worked on it, and we had tremendous security. We took the sick people, and we’re working with them. We have doctors. We have great doctors, military doctors. From a humane standpoint, not that we’re in love with this, these are two massive ships, but we have to take care of people. We have to take care of them.
--
Donald Trump: (42:40)
We sent many back to Canada. The Canadians came and worked very closely with us as did the UK. We had a lot of people from the UK, and we took care of the Americans. We took care of the sick. We had some people very sick. I think we had three to four, maybe five people that had died on the boat, one of the boats actually, and we had to take care of these people. So we could have let them float aimlessly into the ocean looking for port as they’ve been doing for a long time, and I made the decision we had to take them in. Homeland Security and a lot of other people did a great job, but we had to help people. These are people that were very, very sick. Some were dying. Some died. Please. Go ahead. Yeah, go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (43:35)
No, I’m not concerned. No. I had a test yesterday.
--
Donald Trump: (43:41)
I don’t know. I mean, I heard from the oil executives. These are people, most of them had not had the test, and frankly I think they left the room feeling good about a lot of things, but they felt good about the test. This was a test that took, I guess, 13 minutes to have it finalized. They took the test. I don’t know. I didn’t know they were doing that. Maybe they did it just for them. I don’t know. But it seems that a lot of people, because now we have tests that really work well. Abbott, in this case Abbott. We have other tests being developed right now that are also fantastic. The original tests, the ones we inherited, Jim, as an example, they were broken. They were obsolete. They were not good tests, and that’s what we got stuck with. We’ve developed some incredible tests, but this took 13 to 15 minutes, and they were all fine. Go ahead. Finish your question.
--
Donald Trump: (44:44)
Well, I address it in the following manner. We really are very well supplied. We are not the principal. It’s the hospitals, the states, the cities, they’re supposed to get everything they can and stock up in case something like this happens. But nobody could ever have assumed that something like this happened. So we started supplying. We brought tremendous amounts to New York today and over the last few days. We brought them to Louisiana. We brought them to Michigan. We brought them to Los Angeles. A lot of equipment.
--
Donald Trump: (45:16)
You’ve read the amount of masks that we had. I think I said over 8 million masks. The n95 masks, the more expensive, more complicated, better, whatever masks, the ones they want to use in the hospitals, we have millions of them now. We’ve given them to a lot. We sent to Bellevue in New York today. That was from Mayor de Blasio? 200,000 of them, but we have 8.1 million.
--
Donald Trump: (45:45)
We’re going to have more than that and we’re getting them from various sources, including the military. We’re rapidly then replacing them because we have to replace them in case there’s another emergency. Gowns too. We have many gowns being delivered and have been delivered. Our people have done an incredible job. Most people have said, and I said this yesterday, governors have said thank you very much. Great job. If they’re a Democrat governor, in some cases, not in all cases at all.
--
Donald Trump: (46:14)
If I said, “Here’s 1000 ventilators. How many do you want?” “We want 1000.” “Here’s 1000. You got them. But you know what we’re going to do? We’re going to add another 5,000. Is that good?” They said, “Wow, that’s great.” Then if Jim Acosta goes and says, “Are you happy with the president?” “No, he should have given us 10,000.” That’s what’s happening. You know why? Because that’s a standard political answer, and that’s a shame because we have done a job like nobody’s ever done a job. But we’ve just delivered a lot of masks. We’ve just delivered a lot of gowns and protective gear. But you’re talking about a massive number. But as of this morning, people were very, very happy. Steve?
--
Donald Trump: (46:56)
No, they didn’t ask for a bailout, no.
--
Donald Trump: (47:01)
It was really more of a discussion than asking. We did discuss the concept of tariffs because, as you know, this was a dispute among a couple of countries that I think they want to be able to get it solved. They had a dispute. They had a competition, but they want to get it resolved. Russia and Saudi Arabia, I think they want to get it-
--
Donald Trump: (47:24)
Yeah, I think they want to get it resolved. I think they’re working very hard. I mean, they told me they want to get it resolved. They’re working very hard. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (47:44)
What are you asking?
--
Donald Trump: (47:47)
What’s that? A got you? I got you. You used the word our.
--
Donald Trump: (47:50)
Our, you know what our means? United States of America. That’s what it means.
--
Donald Trump: (47:55)
Our. Our. It means the United States of America. Then we take that our, and we distribute it to the states. Not that we have to-
--
Donald Trump: (48:06)
Because we need it for the government, and we need it for the federal government. But when the states are in-
--
Donald Trump: (48:12)
No to also keep-
--
Donald Trump: (48:16)
To keep for our country because the federal government needs it too, not just the states. But out of that, we oftentimes choose. As an example, we have almost 10,000 ventilators, and we are ready to rock with those ventilators. We’re going to bring them to various areas of the country that need them. But when he says our, he’s talking about our country. He’s talking-
--
Donald Trump: (48:37)
Excuse me. He’s talking about the federal government. I mean, it’s such a basic, simple question, and you try and make it sound so bad.
--
Donald Trump: (48:46)
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
--
Donald Trump: (48:48)
You know what? You ought to be ashamed. It’s such a simple question. He said our, and our means for the country and our means [crosstalk 00:48:58] for the states because the states are part of the country. Don’t make it sound bad. Don’t make it sound bad. Go ahead, Steve. Go ahead. Back here.
--
Donald Trump: (49:07)
You just asked your question. You just asked your question in a very nasty tone. Let’s go.
--
Donald Trump: (49:14)
Please.
--
Donald Trump: (49:15)
I gave you a perfect answer. You know it. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (49:28)
Sure, but it’s also needed for the federal government. We have a federal stockpile, and they have state stockpiles, and frankly they were, many of the states were totally unprepared for this. So we had to go into the federal stockpile, but we’re not an ordering clerk. They have to have for themselves. Now some of the states were in good shape. Some of the states were not in good shape. That’s probably something you could expect.
--
Donald Trump: (49:51)
We have been helping states. We have been spending a tremendous amount of time, effort and billions and billions of dollars on making sure that they have what they have. I mean, take New York. We built them hospitals. I built them four hospitals, built them medical centers, sent a ship with 1,000 rooms and 12 operating rooms. Then on top of that gave vast numbers of ventilators and vast numbers of surgical gowns, equipment, masks, everything else.
--
Donald Trump: (50:19)
Now they had a chance to order ventilators over the years. They had a chance to order very big, but they didn’t choose to do it. We were there, and we helped them, and I think the governor of New York is very thankful for the help that we gave. But we have a stockpile. It’s a federal stockpile. We can use that for states, or we can use it for ourselves. We do use it for the federal government. We have a very big federal government. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (50:50)
We’re not a traffic cop. We’re a humanitarian cop. We help. It’s like the ships. Do you think we wanted to take two big ships into our country that have obvious problems? You know the problems I’m talking about. So I have a decision to make. Do I take them in, or do I save lives? Okay? Do I take them in, or do I save? I decided to take them in.
--
Donald Trump: (51:13)
We have tremendous protection. We have great doctors there to help the people. They had four or five people that died. That was as of last night. They died on the ships. We took care of it. Now the people are in the process of, and many are already back in Canada. They’re back in the UK, United Kingdom, and many of them were American citizens. Some were very sick. We’re taking care of the sick people. We’re testing all of the others very, very carefully, very, very carefully. They are being tested like you wouldn’t believe, and we solve a humanitarian catastrophe. You know why? Because nobody else would take the ships. Nobody else would take them. So we docked them in, I think, Fort Lauderdale.
--
Donald Trump: (52:06)
We do say that. We say, and we use the act. Excuse me. We do say that, and we use the act. We’ve used it a number of times very powerfully, and a lot of times we don’t have to use it because we say we’re going to use it if you don’t do this or that. Then we also have companies that act incredibly well. We have plenty of them, mostly them, but we’ve used the act very powerfully. A lot of times you don’t have to exercise the act. All you have to do is tell them, “Look, if you don’t do this, we’re going to use the act.” We’ve done a good job with it. Maybe a great job. Yeah.
--
Donald Trump: (52:48)
No. Me sign? No. There’s millions of checks. I’m going to sign them? No. It’s a Trump administration initiative, but do I want to sign them? No. The people are getting their money. There’s a lot of stimulus going in a lot of different ways. There’s also a stimulus going for companies that, if it weren’t for our government, would not and some companies that were very strong a month ago.
--
Donald Trump: (53:11)
Again, we had the strongest economy in the world. We had our best ever. We had probably the best economy in the history of the world, bigger than China, bigger than anybody, and one day we have to say, close it up, stop. Everybody, go home. You know what? It’s pretty tough to do that.
--
Donald Trump: (53:35)
I don’t know. All I can tell you is that small business today is that we’re way ahead of schedule. There is a problem, which I pointed out, I said you shouldn’t do it this way, with unemployment, where 40 year old equipment by the states. We’re sending the money to the states. Once the money is sent to the states, then the states, whether they’re Republican or Democrat, have to get the money out to the people. Hopefully they will be able to do it. But many of those states have 40 year old computers. I don’t know that they’re equipped. I wanted to give the money direct if that’s what you’re talking about. I wanted to give the money out direct. It Would have been much easier. But the Democrats and some people said, no, let’s do it the complicated way.
--
Donald Trump: (54:17)
All right. Excuse me. I was talking about both. They’ll get it. They will. Go ahead please.
--
Donald Trump: (59:08)
It is going to go away.
--
Donald Trump: (59:13)
I didn’t say a day. I said it’s going away, and it is going away. Okay. Are you … Okay. That was a good answer to your question. No, no, no, no, no, no more. That was a long but a very good answer. That was enough for you.
--
Donald Trump: (59:34)
Yeah, we’re going to do that.
--
Donald Trump: (59:41)
We will be talking about that at a different time. Yeah, please go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (59:57)
That’s up to Dr. Birx. You will decide.
--
Donald Trump: (01:00:08)
I’m sure they’ll talk to you about that, and Dr. Fauci, too. Please. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:01:50)
No, they should’ve had more ventilators at the time. They should have had more ventilators. They were totally under-serviced. We are trying to do, we’re doing our best for New York. We have states. We have a lot of states. We have territory’s too, but we have a lot of states that have to be taken care of, some much more so than others. We’ve worked very well with the governor. We happen to think that he’s well-served with ventilators. We’re going to find out, but we have other states to take care of. We have a big problem in Louisiana. We have a big problem in Michigan.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:24)
We have a big problem and seven other really strong hotspots, but we’re doing the best we can. I wish they did the original orders three years ago. They would’ve had all the ventilators they needed, although even then they wouldn’t. Because if you look at what the original request was from New York, it was far greater than anybody ever heard and we’ve supplied a lot. I told you we supplied some just today to New York and we supplied some yesterday to New York City. Did you have one in the back? Yeah, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:59)
I don’t think that was the question.
--
Donald Trump: (01:03:13)
No, he didn’t misspeak.
--
Donald Trump: (01:03:15)
He used the word, our. Okay. Our. Our is referring to our country …
--
Donald Trump: (01:03:20)
The states, to the best of my knowledge and to the best of your knowledge, are a part of our country. We are taking what is in the federal stockpile and we are helping states all over the country, but we also want to keep some because when that surge comes, when you hit those peaks, we’re going to need, we have to be able to have the flexibility to take those ventilators and bring them to Louisiana, New York, Detroit, different places. That’s all.
--
Donald Trump: (01:03:46)
Of course, we’re not using them anywhere else. We’re not going to be using them, John, anywhere else. But we want the flexibility because we don’t even know when the surge is coming but it’s coming soon and it’s going to be big and some areas won’t have it. Some areas will be pleasantly surprised just like we’ve been, you look at the chart. States that I thought would have been maybe a disaster turned out to be really, they’d done a great job. Some states are really trouble, but you don’t know. You don’t know. We have great flexibility.
--
Donald Trump: (01:04:14)
I would have preferred giving them all out. We’d have nothing and now when we have a surge we can’t get them back from where we gave them because it’s very tough to take it back. So we have tremendous flexibility and it could be New York, it could be Louisiana. Those are two that are really rough. New Jersey is very rough and they’ve done a very good job in New Jersey. But New Jersey is very rough. Go ahead, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:04:40)
The guidelines relative to which? The masks?
--
Donald Trump: (01:04:56)
I just don’t use them.
--
Donald Trump: (01:04:58)
They’re not mandatory guidelines. They’re guidelines. They suggest you could wear them, don’t have to wear them. In fact, the director is here. If you want to say a couple of words about it, you can if you want. You don’t have to. But basically it’s a voluntary thing. Say it directly. Doing a good job.
--
Donald Trump: (01:06:41)
And I was just tested also, so I assume I don’t have the virus so I don’t have to worry about spreading it. Okay. Please go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:06:58)
I’m always considering. Look, tariffs have made a tremendous amount of money for our country. I put them on China, I put them on other places and other countries tariff us and they take advantage of us or they have for many years. Look, countries have taken advantage of the United States for years. They’ve ripped us off like nobody can even believe, whether it be on manufacturing, whether it be on exporting, whether it be on almost anything, including military where we provide virtually free military assistance to countries that frankly take advantage of us. Don’t even like us.
--
Donald Trump: (01:07:33)
Okay. So this has been going on for years. They terrify us, they create artificial, you could say nonfinancial barriers, which are worse than financial barriers. You can’t sell your product. You can’t take care of our farmers. They won’t take our and yet they’ll take us and sell into us and we won’t charge them anything for doing it. Look, they’ve taken advantage of us for years. Tariffs are a way of evening the score. Tariffs are a way of just neutralizing. They have tariffs on us and we now can put tariffs on them. Am I using it for oil? It’s something we can. No.
--
Donald Trump: (01:08:10)
Am I doing it now? No. Am I thinking about imposing it as of this moment? No. But if we’re not treated fairly, it’s certainly a tool in the toolbox.
--
Donald Trump: (01:08:24)
It would be the same thing. No. It would be the same thing. They are having a dispute, the two countries, and it’s hurting the rest of the world because it’s really hurting the energy industry. Russia’s being hurt unbelievably badly and Saudi Arabia is being hurt unbelievably badly because oil and gas is a primary, that’s where they get most of their income. And this is a price like from the 1950s. Right? It’s a price from the 1950s. They are being hurt very badly. I think they’re going to settle their dispute pretty quickly. Go ahead, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:09:11)
Well, they haven’t production. That’s what they’ve done. They’ve increased it so much that they’re, so you meant the opposite.
--
Donald Trump: (01:09:18)
Look, well, they’re going to stop because the market. Ultimately, the market is going to get them to stop, but they both did the opposite. They increased production to a level that water is right now more valuable than oil. Who would have ever thought? You go to some of these kingdoms, water is far more valuable than oil. There’s so much oil. It’s a tribute in a way. But what happened is there was a lot to start off with and then you had the virus and it knocked the hell out of the market in terms of demand. So there is no demand and this tremendous supply.
--
Donald Trump: (01:09:56)
So, I mean you saw our numbers where it was down to 20 and down frankly below 20. It was even below 20. It’s an incredible thing, the market, but ultimately the marketplace will take care of it. But I think they’re going to work out their problem fairly quickly. Okay. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:10:29)
I’d talk. If it were important to talk to her, I’d talk to her. If it were important for the American people, I’d talk to her. But other than that, I can have other people talking to her. Look, you ready? Infrastructure is a great thing for me. I think infrastructure for this country, we have an old broken infrastructure. 50 years ago, we were the envy of the world and then we spent all this money so stupidly in the Middle East. We spent, it’s going to be very close to $8 trillion in the Middle East. How stupid was that decision? But they spent it on that and other things.
--
Donald Trump: (01:11:03)
We’ve got to fix our infrastructure. That means roads, highways, tunnels, airports, everything. We got to fix our infrastructure. And the beauty is because of the fact that we are so strong as a country, we’re borrowing at zero. We never had a chance to borrow at zero. Even this country, we never had a chance to borrow at zero. We’re going to borrow. This is a great time so we can fix our infrastructure and we’ll have almost no interest because this is the time to do it. Steve, one more question.
--
Donald Trump: (01:11:38)
Which one? I have many trajectories for many things.
--
Donald Trump: (01:11:47)
Say it, Steve. What?
--
Donald Trump: (01:11:50)
On what?
--
Donald Trump: (01:11:54)
I’d have to ask Dr. Fauci, and I’d have to ask Deborah. Have the models changed?
--
Donald Trump: (01:13:34)
The models show hundreds of thousands of people are going to die. You know what I want to do? I want to come away under the models. If professionals did the models, I was never involved in a model, but…at least this is kind of a model…but you know what, hundreds of thousands of people they say are going to die, I want much less than that. I want none. But it’s too late for that, but I want very few people relative to what the models are saying. Those are projections. I hope they’re wrong. I hope we’re going to be under those projections.
--
Donald Trump: (01:14:10)
How come you always have two? Why can’t you have one?
--
Donald Trump: (01:14:13)
Every time, I have three questions. I have two questions. Can you give me one instead because there are a couple of other people? Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:14:38)
The general election will happen on November 3rd. In Wisconsin, what happened is I, through social media, put out a very strong endorsement of a Republican conservative judge who’s an excellent, brilliant judge. He’s a justice. And I hear what happened is his poll numbers went through the roof and because of that, I think they delayed the election.
--
Donald Trump: (01:15:04)
I don’t know. Why didn’t he do it before? He’s doing the right before the election.
--
Donald Trump: (01:15:08)
Excuse me. Why didn’t he do this two weeks ago? All of a sudden, excuse me. All of a sudden, an election which is taking place very soon, gets delayed now. I just endorsed him today and it was a very strong endorsement. His polls, he’s gone very high up and all of a sudden the governor comes out, the Democrat governor, by the way, comes out and says, oh, we’re going to move this election. So I don’t know. I hope you’re right. I hope you’re right.
--
Donald Trump: (01:15:39)
No. I think a lot of people cheat with mail in voting. I think people should vote with ID, voter ID. I think voter ID is very important and the reason they don’t want voter ID is because they intend to cheat. When you get something, when you buy something, you look at your cards and credit cards and different cards. You have your picture and many of them, not all of them, but on many of them, you should have a picture on your for voting. It should be called voter ID. They should have that and it shouldn’t be mail in, excuse me. It shouldn’t be mail in voting.
--
Donald Trump: (01:16:11)
It should be you go to a booth and you proudly display yourself. You don’t send it in the mail where people pick up. All sorts of bad things can happen by the time they sign that, if they sign that, if they sign that, by the time it gets in and it’s tabulated. No, it shouldn’t be mailed in. You should vote at the booth and you should have voter ID. Because when you have voter ID, that’s the real deal. Thank you very much. We’ll see you tomorrow.
Donald Trump: (03:41)
Thank you very much. Thank you very much. This week, America continues our aggressive effort to defeat the virus as we enter a crucial and difficult phase of the battle. We continue to send our prayers to the people of New York in New Jersey and to our whole country, but right now New York and New Jersey are very hot zones and we’re with them. We’re with everybody. Your struggle is our struggle and we will beat this virus. We will beat it together. I also want to send best wishes to a very good friend of mine and a friend to our nation, prime minister, Boris Johnson. We’re very saddened to hear that he was taken into intensive care this afternoon, a little while ago, and Americans are all praying for his recovery. He’s been a really good friend, he’s been really something very special. Strong, resolute, doesn’t quit, doesn’t give up.
--
Donald Trump: (04:48)
We have made tremendous progress on therapeutics. I had a fantastic call today, which I’ll be talking about a little bit later and I’ve asked two of the leading companies, these are brilliant companies, Ebola, AIDS, others, they’ve come with the solutions and just have done incredible jobs. And I’ve asked them to contact London immediately. They have offices in London and major companies, but more than major, more than size, they’re genius. And I had a talk with four of them today and they speak a language that most people don’t even understand, but I understand something that they’ve really advanced therapeutics and therapeutically and they have arrived in London already. Their London office has whatever they need, and we’ll see if we can be of help. We’ve contacted all of Boris’s doctors and we’ll see what is going to take place, but they are ready to go. But when you get brought into intensive care, that gets very, very serious with this particular disease.
--
Donald Trump: (06:00)
So the two companies are there and with what they are talking about and it’s rather complex and has had really incredible results. We’re working with the FDA and everybody else, but we are working with London, with respect to Boris Johnson. Across the country we’re attacking the enemy in all fronts, including medical, scientific, social, logistical and economic. We’re pressing into action the full power of American government and American enterprise and our military has been incredible. We’ve just sent 3,000 public health personnel. They’re now deployed in the New York area and they’ll be over at the Javits center, over at the great ship.
--
Donald Trump: (06:51)
As you probably have heard, and I was informed that Governor Cuomo has already told you and announced, he called me up a little while ago and he asked whether or not it would be possible to use the ship with respect to fighting the virus. And we hadn’t had that in mind at all, but we’re going to let him do it and we’re also going to let New Jersey, Governor Murphy, we spoke with him a little while ago, and New Jersey is going to use it also because New Jersey is a hotspot. So Governor Murphy and governor Cuomo are going to be using the ship from New York, New Jersey and it’s a big ship and it’s now COVID. It’s set for COVID, and we are going to … Hopefully that will be very helpful to both states.
--
Donald Trump: (07:46)
The Javits Center, which has 2,900 beds just built by our military also is going to be manned now by the military and they should be in place tomorrow and they’ll start sending quite a few people over to the Javits Center. It’s convenient, it’s right in the middle of everything so that’ll be something great, and we appreciated Governor Cuomo’s nice, really nice statements and likewise Governor Murphy. We have worked very well with both of them and with, frankly, all of the governors. Vice President Pence had a call this morning with them that lasted for close to two hours, and I understand there wasn’t a negative person on the call. 50 governors or just about 50 governors. I think they were all on, from what I understood, and they were very positive about everything their federal government has been doing for them.
--
Donald Trump: (08:42)
You’ll hear what that is, and it’s rather amazing, actually. Nationwide, the Army Corps of Engineers is building 22 field hospitals, these are big hospitals, and alternate care sites in 18 states. So you have a combination of 22 field hospitals. In addition to that, we’re building ultimate care sites, which is a little bit of a smaller version of the hospital, and we have a lot of them and they’re going up in 18 different states. In total we have deployed 8,450 hospital beds from federal stockpiles, and if you think this has done over really a period of weeks, that’s incredible, actually.
--
Donald Trump: (09:26)
More than 8,000 ventilators have been sent from the national stockpile to our cities and States backed by the defense production act, which we’ve used very strongly, very powerfully. So powerfully that we don’t have to use it too much, frankly, and it’s nice to when you don’t have to. We’re getting more than we ever bargained for. American industry is stepping up. Manufacturers are really going to town and we have thousands of ventilators being built as we speak and we have hundreds that are being sent to different locations and we’re ready to roll with almost 10,000 that we have in the federal stockpile.
--
Donald Trump: (10:07)
When I say ready to roll to, I mean exactly what that states. We are … Wherever that monster goes, we’re able to move with it. Great flexibility. We have tremendous flexibility, and we have people waiting and they’re ready, willing and able, but waiting to bring them wherever it may be if they need it. If they need it, it’s possible that they won’t be needed, that we’re fully stocked because numbers are coming in where because of what the American people are doing, we’re having fewer hospital visits. I think that could be the case in New York. It could be the case in a few other states. And fewer beds, fewer hospital visits mean fewer ventilators. So we’ll see whether or not our original projections were right. But anyway, I had a very good talk with both governors and I think they’re very happy, extremely happy about what we’re doing for them. And especially going all COVID. So that’ll take place almost immediately.
--
Donald Trump: (11:09)
FEMA and HHS have directly distributed 11.7 million N95 respirators. Think of that. Get the number. 11.7 million N95 respirators, 11.7 million. 26.5 million surgical masks, 5.3 million face shields, 4.4 million surgical gowns, and 22.6 million gloves, 22.6 million gloves. We have also arranged for our vast quantities of additional materials to be allocated through donations and existing supply chains. We’ve also given tremendous medical material and supplies throughout the 50 states and territories and through Project Airbridge, we have succeeded in bringing plane loads of vital supplies into the United States from overseas. We had an additional three … These are massive planes by the way. They’re big planes, very big, very powerful and that they’re loaded to the gills with supplies and rather than bringing them into our stock file, as we’ve discussed, we bring them to all the different locations where they’re needed so we can save a big step, and a timely step.
--
Donald Trump: (12:33)
Because of my actions under the DPA, I can also announce today that we have reached an agreement, very amicable agreement with 3M for the delivery of an additional 55.5 million high quality face masks each month so that we’re going to be getting, over the next couple of months, 166.5 million masks for our frontline healthcare workers. So the 3M saga ends very happily. We’re very proud to be dealing now with 3M and its CEO, Mike Roman. I just spoke with him and I thanked him for getting it done and Mike was very happy to get it done. Great company. So we’re getting 166.5 million masks and mostly that’s going to be for our front line healthcare workers. Okay. That’s 3M, thank you 3M. Three on. I also want to thank Apple, one of the many great American companies that’s taken into … That’s really leapt into action. Today Apple announced that it is now producing plastic face shields for healthcare workers at the rate of one million per week. One million. And these are the shields that you see on television quite a bit and they’re at the highest level of quality and safety.
--
Donald Trump: (14:03)
We’re grateful as well to Salesforce, which has donated 48 million pieces of personal protective equipment, including masks, gowns, suits and face shields. So thank you very much to Salesforce. I urge all of our nation’s governors to ensure that the massive deliveries that we’ve made to your states over the past few weeks are distributed as quickly as possible. So again, we’re working very well with the governors. Now they may see you and say, “Oh, we’re not happy.” But they’re very happy on the phone. And Mike Pence is a straight shooter and he had a great phone conversation to them with all of the … Teleconference and they’re very happy, every one of them. Were there any negatives?
--
Donald Trump: (14:51)
See? I told you. Mike is the greatest. Mike … And you have done a great job. Mike, and I appreciate it. The whole country appreciates it. Anthony appreciates it, right? Don’t you? See? Everybody appreciates Mike. Special man. So a lot of the things that we’ve done, again, are going directly to the states. The states seem to be very happy if they’re not, they can call me directly, they can call Mike directly and we’ll make them happy. But tremendous progress has been made in a very short period. And I think very importantly the progress has been made before the surge comes. Because the next week, week and a half is going to be a big surge, the professionals tell us, and I think we’re in good shape for it, Anthony, so it’s good timing, really good timing. We can have this stuff there. It’s already there for the most part, but we’re bringing a lot of different resources to the various locations, especially where the surge is looking like it’s going to take place. Resources from the national stockpile need to reach our warriors, and they are warriors.
--
Donald Trump: (15:55)
I tell it all the time. I saw it again this morning. These young and many cases, many cases older, but they’re walking into the hospital and they’re putting on … I mean, as their doors open, they’re going into this place and it’s not exactly to safe and they’re going in there and they’re putting the outfits on, they’re putting their masks on and they’re … It’s incredible. It’s like no different than you watch the war movies or you watch the old clips of war, running up hills. To me it’s the same thing. Men and women, young and old, but a lot of young people just going in there. They’re not thinking about, “Oh gee, this is dangerous.” They’re not saying, “I don’t want to go in.” They’re warriors, they’re running through those doors. It’s the most incredible thing. It’s beautiful, it’s an incredible, beautiful thing.
--
Donald Trump: (16:48)
Resources from the national stockpile need to reach these warriors in the hospitals immediately, and we’re making sure they do. And again, the states have that responsibility, but we’re working with the states, we’re getting the states a lot of things that they could distribute, or when they tell us we bring it directly to the hospital from the federal stockpile or from the planes that land, without even going to the stockpile. If any state’s having difficulty distributing supplies, we urge you to use the National Guard to assist in the delivery. And I have to say you have done a fantastic job. Debra, you know that you’ve done great. Tony, you know that you’ve done great, but what a job you’ve done and I appreciate it. I really do. Your whole group has been incredible. That’s a lot of stars you have. I’ll tell you that. He’s supposed to do a great job when you have four stars. Right? But the military has been incredible and I thank them for all of us.

Donald Trump: (17:49)
Conversely, if a state believes that it has surplus equipment or supplies, very important because we actually have gotten so much to some of the States that they are able to now … They’ve done a fantastic job and they’ve kept that line low and we have some States that have surplus equipment and supplies and they’re working with us to rapidly redeploy those supplies to areas of greatest need. We thought that might happen. If it worked out well, that’s what was going to happen and it’s happening and I want to thank Governor Gavin Newsome, who is doing a tremendous job, who’s announced California will send 500 ventilators to be distributed to other locations. I think some are going to Arizona, some are going to Washington DC.
--
Donald Trump: (18:38)
We think they’re going to Delaware. We’re working to that, but 500 excess of ventilators from the state of California and we’re going to get them taken care of wherever they have to go. Those decisions are being made right now. The members of the White House task force and I are in close touch with mayors and governors and hospital administrators of course our country, and we’re told that the present time, at the present time, most of the critical needs are being more than met. States have to continue sharing detailed information and the amount and utilization rates of medical supplies so we know what to resupply them or they can get it directly. That includes ventilators. They can get it directly, ideally they can get it directly, but if they can’t, if they’re unable to do it, we have tremendous amounts of supplies and we’re building it up very fast too, and this is before the big surge.
--
Donald Trump: (19:40)
This information is fundamental to our ability to deliver the material when and where it’s most needed. Now, Mike in his conversation today, I think got some information as to a couple of locations where we’re going to be delivering large numbers of ventilators and large numbers of medical supplies, and we’ll take care of that. But some of the States are very happy. Even Governor Pritzker from Illinois is happy. Of course, he may not be happy when he talks to the press, but he’s happy. He’s a very happy man. We’re increasingly hopeful that the aggressive mitigation strategy we put into place will ultimately allow our hospital system to successfully manage the major influx of cases that we have right now. Again, I say that we’re finding, because of the incredible job done by the American people, in conjunction with everybody, governors, the military, federal government, state government, local government, had a lot of conversations with New York City and Mayor De Blasio.
--
Donald Trump: (20:50)
I’ve gotten to know him. I didn’t know him, gotten to know him and a lot of people are working hard. Everybody’s working hard. A lot of people are doing a great job, tell you that, a lot of people are doing a great job. But the goal is that all Americans have been sacrificing to achieve these last few weeks, things that a lot of people thought were not possible to achieve, and I think we’ve more than achieved, but we have to go through, again, we’re going to have a rough week. We’re going to have maybe a rough little more than a week, but there’s tremendous light at the end of that tunnel. I said it last time, said it last night. There’s tremendous light at the end of the tunnel. There’s so many things happening with therapeutics, with vaccines, with things that we really want. Debra, Tony, they’re all working so hard on this, but those therapeutics,
--
Donald Trump: (21:41)
I mean, look, the vaccines are going to be always a little bit later because of that testing period. But the therapeutics getting the kinds of things that I heard about today, talking to these brilliant companies and brilliant people on the phone was fantastic. It was such an incredible conversation. I also spoke just a few minutes ago with former Vice President Biden who called and we had a really wonderful warm conversation. It was a very nice conversation. We talked about pretty much this, this is what we talked about, this is what everyone’s talking about, this is what they want to talk about. And he gave me his point of view and I fully understood that, and we just had a very friendly conversation. Lasted probably 15 minutes, and it was really good. It was really good. Really nice. I think it was very much so. I appreciate his calling. As we continue our efforts to develop treatments and cures, this afternoon I spoke with leaders of the American pharmaceutical companies, and just to give you their names, Amgen, Genentech, Gilead, Regeneron. These are four of the greatest in the world for doing exactly what they’re doing.
--
Donald Trump: (23:04)
Currently 10 different therapeutic agents are inactive trials and some are looking incredibly successful, but we have to go through a process and it’s got to be a fairly quick process, I will tell you, based on what the FDA told me. And another 15 are in plans for clinical trials, so they’re advancing rapidly and today a second company announced that the FDA has authorized its vaccine candidate to begin clinical trial. So you have Johnson and Johnson is already there. I believe they’re the one that’s first, and now we have a second company that just announced and we were just … Was just approved. So we have two companies at level for the vaccine. We’ve now performed 100 … Well, if you think of this, 1.79 million tests, that’s 1,790,000 test nationwide. And I think we’re going to put up a screen here someplace that they’re on cue, but just on cue.
--
Donald Trump: (24:07)
Here it is. This is the process starting on five March and ending right there, right about now, right? That’s about it. And it’s going up at a rapid rate. Nobody has done more testing. And one of the reasons why they say, and I think I can say this, Debra, very strongly, but one of the reasons that we have more cases is we’ve done more testing. And if I went to some of these countries that have, in my opinion, far more people than we do that had the problem. And if we did the kind of testing proportionally that we’re doing that have many more cases than us, but we have more cases because we do much more testing. So when you do the testing, you have cases, otherwise you wouldn’t know about the cases. People sit home, you don’t know about it. But we have now done 1, 790,000 tests nationwide.
--
Donald Trump: (25:03)
That’s more than any other country in the world, hence we have more cases and that number is growing by nearly 125,000 people per day. Think of that one. So it’s growing by 125,000 people per day. I told you about South Korea. This is vastly faster and we also have, they say, the most accurate of tests. CVS is launching, and they’ve been great, two new drive through testing sites and Atlanta, Georgia and Providence, Rhode Island and each location would be able to test up to 1,000 patients per day using the ultra fast five minute test developed by Abbott Labs. Now they’re down to five minutes. They go to the ultra fast. It’s very accurate. Abbott Labs, I want to thank them. They’ve been fantastic. We’re also speeding urgent economic relief to the American worker and families and the employers.
--
Donald Trump: (26:05)
As of today, tens of thousands of small businesses have applied for more than $40 billion in relief under the paycheck protection program. You’ve all been reading about it and it’s really … I mean, it’s only been going for a couple of days. It’s really been performing well. A couple of little glitches, minor glitches that are already been taken care of, what they say. These funds were resulted in nearly two million jobs being preserved, so we’re taking care of our workers, small businesses and our workers. Nearly 3,000 lenders have already made loans under the program and we’re signing up additional lenders very quickly, rapidly. Community banks have been very responsive and larger banks are also stepping up if this … If we run out of funds, by the way, we’re already preparing because it’s going so fast for the small businesses and their employees, we’ll ask Congress to refill it immediately, but the banks have been great.
--
Donald Trump: (27:01)
The big banks, the Bank of America was right up there at the beginning. JP Morgan Chase was … Has been great. After the first day, they really came through and a lot of the big banks, but the community banks have been fantastic. As we announced last week, we are providing $100 billion in direct support for our hospitals. And the first traunch, $30 billion, will be distributed this week. I want to say one other thing. Our farmers, we love our farmers, and as you know, as of April 1st the China trade deal, $250 billion, they purchased $250 billion from us, if not more. And of that, approximately 50 billion is expected to be with our farmers. So it kicked in as of April 1st and we’ll see how it goes. It seems like they’re buying. So we’ll let you know how that’s going, but they’re buying anywhere from 40 to $50 billion worth of our agricultural product. That should have a huge impact on our farmers, a tremendous impact on our farmers. But we’re watching it very closely.
--
Donald Trump: (28:14)
To fight the medical war, we’ve mobilized the unbeatable and it just … It is unbeatable strength of American determination, ingenuity and compassion. I got to see that when I spoke to the great science, because I call them science companies more than drug companies, they’re scientists. We’ve seen businesses, charities, and private citizens making generous donations. So many people are making donations. We’ve seen states and cities supporting and helping each other and caring for our citizens, and we’ve seen Americans of all backgrounds and beliefs uniting together to answer the challenge and rise to the moment, and that’s what they’re doing. Above all, we’ve been awed, inspired by the exceptional courage of the doctors, nurses, EMTS, and healthcare workers, who are the soldiers of this war. No words can ever express the complete measure of our gratitude for these intrepid heroes.
--
Donald Trump: (29:14)
One Cleveland patient credited his medical team for not only saving his life through their skill, but forever changing his life through their example of selfless devotion. Couldn’t believe it. So generous he was with his statements and he talked about their bravery in an area that was in such trouble, an area of that hospital where people were dying and he talked about their bravery. Another survivor in Euston said simply, “I will consider them my angels forever.” I will consider them, think of that, my angels forever as our nation endures the depths of loss and grief. We also witnessed to the summit of American virtue, character, and courage with the love and dedication of every American Patriot. We will win this battle, we will defeat this enemy, and we will rise from this present crisis with new strength, unity, and resolve and that’s what’s happening.
--
Donald Trump: (30:13)
Tremendous stories are coming out of this horrible moment, very dark moment for the world. 182. I was saying 151 for a while and then it got up to 160 and 182, as I announced yesterday, 182 countries are being attacked by this virus. So I just want to thank everybody. I want to thank the American citizens for doing a great job. Stay inside and let’s win this and let’s get our country open as soon as we can. I think it’s going to be sooner than people think. Things are going really well. Again, light at the end of the tunnel. And with that I’ll take a few questions and then Mike is going to take over and talk with the admiral and with the professionals and we appreciate you being here. Yes, please?
--
Donald Trump: (31:15)
Yeah, it’s a very complex treatment of things that they’ve just recently developed and that they have a lot of experience with having to do with something else, but recent for this. And they’ve already concurred, they’ve already had meetings with the doctors and we’ll see whether or not they want to go that route. But when you’re in intensive care, it’s a big deal. So they’re there and they’re ready. I think we have … Well, we have three of them. I spoke with four, you know who the four would be, and the people within those, you’d know the companies, I told you the companies, but the people are the greatest in the world. So they’re at the hospital and we’ll see. And they have everything with them should it be needed. Hopefully it won’t have to be needed, but should it be needed. I found Boris to be a fantastic person, just like a fantastic warm, strong, smart guy. He loves his country. You see that. I mean, he fought like hell for his country. And intensive care is big stuff. Really big.
--
Donald Trump: (32:37)
I don’t think so. Mike had his test a couple of days ago. I had my test couple of days ago. And we’re here and here you are. So no, I don’t think so. But I think we’ll probably … Just because of the questions like that, I think we’ll probably have maybe quite a few tests. It’s not the worst idea. The system of testing now is so quick and so easy. So I could see … And you were tested again today? You sure you’re okay?
--
Donald Trump: (33:03)
[inaudible 00:33:08].
--
Donald Trump: (33:31)
Did I hear the word inspector general? Really? It’s wrong. And they’ll talk to you about it. It’s wrong.
--
Donald Trump: (33:39)
Well, where did he come from, the inspector general. What’s his name?
--
Donald Trump: (33:43)
What’s his name?
--
Donald Trump: (33:45)
Well, find me his name, let me know. Okay? If you find me his name, I’d appreciate it.
--
Donald Trump: (33:51)
All I can tell you is this. It’s been put up on the board, you’re going to ask the admiral, but we are doing-
--
Donald Trump: (34:03)
We’ve done more-
--
Donald Trump: (34:03)
We’ve I’ve done more testing and had more results than any country, anywhere in the world. They’re doing an incredible job now. They’re all calling us. They want our testing. What are we doing? How do you do the five minute test? How do you do the 15 minute test? So give me the name of the inspector general. Could politics be entered into that? Go ahead, please. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (34:36)
I don’t like that decision. I didn’t hear that that was his decision. I know that he stopped it for other countries. I spoke to him yesterday. We had a very good talk and we’ll see whether or not that is. I would be surprised if he would because India does very well with the United States. For many years they’ve been taken advantage of the United States on trade. So I would be surprised if that were his decision. He’d have to tell me that. I spoke to him Sunday morning, called him, and I said, we’d appreciate your allowing our supply to come out. If he doesn’t allow it to come out, that would be okay. But of course there may be retaliation. Why wouldn’t there be? Yeah.
--
Donald Trump: (35:18)
I don’t think so. I think it’s done very well.
--
Donald Trump: (35:23)
Not any more they haven’t.
--
Donald Trump: (35:29)
Bank of America has been the leader. Taking tremendous numbers of applications, and of course there may have been, they wanted to have a slightly different application. They wanted to have a little different information, but Bank of America has been a leader. They had number one in terms of applications.
--
Donald Trump: (35:45)
I wish you’d ask the question differently. Why don’t you say “It’s gotten off to a tremendous start, but there were some little glitches,” which by the way, have been worked out. It will be so much nicer if you do that, but you’re just incapable of asking a question.
--
Donald Trump: (36:01)
It’s already done. It’s already done.
--
Donald Trump: (36:05)
It’s taking the measures and we may even do a different system. Not with this. We’re going to have to probably add more money to this to save and to keep our small businesses going and to keep the employees of those small businesses working. But it’s such a positive event and you ask it in such a negative way. It’s just, I wish we had a fair media in this country and we really don’t. Speaking of unfair, go right ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (36:45)
Well I haven’t heard it exactly. I haven’t heard. I heard they had a statement that was made. If that were the statement, it’s a strong statement. Look, the letters shouldn’t have been sent and certainly they shouldn’t have been leaked. This is a military operation. I must tell you, I’ve heard very good things about the gentleman, both gentlemen, by the way, I will say this, but about both gentlemen. And I may look into it only from the standpoint that something should be resolved because I’m hearing good things about both people.
--
Donald Trump: (37:20)
I may just get involved if it’s okay with you. Because you know what? You have two good people and they’re arguing and I’m good, believe it or not, at settling arguments. I’m good at settling these arguments. So I may look into it in detail and I’ll be able to figure it out very fast.
--
Donald Trump: (37:38)
But that was a statement. It’s a rough statement, but look letters should not have been sent to many people unclassified. That was a mistake. It’s a mistake that shouldn’t have been made because it’s unfair to the families of the people on the ship because they get nervous and it shows weakness and there’s nothing weak about us now. Not anymore.
--
Donald Trump: (38:03)
We have the strongest military we’ve ever had, and we’re not going to be showing weakness to anybody because we have… That ship is incredible, nuclear powered aircraft carrier. And we don’t want to be doing writing letters. We don’t want to have letter writing campaigns where the fake news finds a letter or gets a leak. We don’t want that. So the letter, excuse me, so the letter shouldn’t have been sent.
--
Donald Trump: (38:25)
With all of that said his career prior to that was very good. So I’m going to get involved and see exactly what’s going on there because I don’t want to destroy somebody for having a bad day. Okay. Does that make sense?
--
Donald Trump: (38:49)
He did. We agreed that we weren’t going to talk about what we said, but we had a very, very good talk. It was a warm talk. I enjoyed it. I hope he enjoyed it too. And it was short. It was 15 minutes.
--
Donald Trump: (39:03)
He had suggestions. It doesn’t mean that I agree with those suggestions, but certainly he had suggestions, and I also told him some of the things we’re doing, but the conversation was a friendly, very friendly conversation.
--
Donald Trump: (39:26)
It will be a difficult week and a half.
--
Donald Trump: (39:47)
If Dr. Fauci said that I would be inclined to call them up. We do have a constitutional problem in doing that. You understand that? There’s a double edge, so you understand. I can do it, but it is a constitutional, you can say Federalists, you can say there’s lots of different reasons where I would rather have the governors do it, make their own determination. They’re smaller, and not in all cases, but sort of their smaller cases. But I’m not sure 100% that Dr. Fauci said that. But you can ask him. Do you want to say something please.
--
Donald Trump: (41:07)
Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (42:13)
I think that with the therapies and I think that with the vaccines, which I have total confidence are coming and I’m dealing with the companies, I’m talking to Johnson and Johnson, I’m talking to all of them. I think that when you add the tremendous stimulus that we’re giving, like for instance, deductibility for restaurant expenses, for restaurants and entertainment. The money that we’re talking about for small businesses and employers to keep everybody working, and other things that we’re frankly working on right now, which are going to be great for our people. I think when you add that to it, I think we could get more than back to normal from an economic standpoint, actually be better but more than back to normal.
--
Donald Trump: (42:54)
But I would agree that we’d love to see a vaccine but immediately would love to see a therapeutic, and I think we’re getting great close.
--
Donald Trump: (43:06)
I don’t want to comment on that. But I can tell you that we certainly want to try. We certainly want to see what’s going on. We’re doing very well. Look, you look at most places where you can call it the bump. You could go up the hill, you could go up the mountain, you can call it whatever you want to do it. It’s very flat. You take a look. And that was done through mitigation. That was done through a lot of good work. And that far exceeded our expectations before.
--
Donald Trump: (43:32)
People can’t even believe how low some of those bumps are, some of those hills are, they’re very surprised. They have a couple of tough ones. New Jersey has been very tough and New York has been very tough. They’re crowded in. It’s tight, it’s tougher, but far exceeding, California far exceeds, Washington State far exceeds. You look at so many of these states how well they’re doing.
--
Donald Trump: (43:59)
The eight states by the way. And I haven’t spoken to the governors, but Tony’s so right. They may not have it from the standpoint that they’re saying it, but those people are practicing it and they’re doing a fantastic job. Take a look at where they are in terms of the levels, but take a look where they are. But if I thought it was something that, and I’ve looked at them and I’ve looked at them very carefully. I looked at them today, looked at them yesterday. From a constitutional standpoint, I’d love not to get involved with that and not from a legal standpoint, just from a moral constitutional standpoint. Because legally I can, but morally, and I believe in our constitution much more so than most people. And I’d love to be able to let the governors do what they have to do. Those states are doing a fantastic job. All eight of them, they’re doing a fantastic job. So we’ll see what happens. As for your question, you fully understand what I’m saying. So thank you.
--
Donald Trump: (45:17)
I think Boris was looking at it differently. He was looking at it earlier. He was looking at it like ride it out. There were many people thinking about riding it out. Meaning whatever it is, it is. But then you see what starts to happen and the numbers become monumental and they decided not to do that. And we actually moved early. We moved early because of what we did with respect to the ban on China coming in. And then Europe coming in. That was an early ban too. And then UK.
--
Donald Trump: (45:47)
So no, he waited a little while and he felt that, but he made a decision very quickly thereafter to do what they did and they’ve gone to a very strict lockdown. But they’re suffering greatly as a nation right now. They’re going through a lot. They’re a nation that’s having a difficult time. But I’ve gotten to know him. He’s just such an incredible guy. It was just so shocking to see that because you know what that means. Intensive care is a big deal with regard to what we’re talking about. That’s a very big deal. Very scary deal.
--
Donald Trump: (46:38)
I can get you that information. I think they’d probably be willing to give that, right? Yeah, we could get you that information. Jeff.
--
Donald Trump: (46:57)
We’ll you’re the first one that’s told me that. We’ll have to make that decision and maybe we will. Maybe we won’t, but we’ll have to make that decision. I think the cuts are automatic, if you’re a believer in markets. I can guarantee you there’s a cut from pre this condition. This happened because of the virus. The virus knocked out 40%. It went down in one hour, literally when places close up, you’re talking about a 40% cut. Now, I think it’s happening automatically, but nobody’s asked me that question yet, so we’ll see what happens. I’ll let you know Thursday evening.
--
Donald Trump: (47:36)
I think it’s automatic. because they’re already cutting. If you look, they’re cutting back because it’s market, it’s demand, it’s supply and demand. They’re already cutting back and they’re cutting back very seriously.
--
Donald Trump: (47:51)
Nobody’s asked me that. So if they ask I’ll make a decision. Okay. But again, it’s happening anyway. Yes please.
--
Donald Trump: (48:07)
Yes, so I had physical, the first half was very successful. I did it on a day when I was in the White House and we were able to do that as the doctor reported. And I have some… The second half of the physical different, probably is done at Walter Reed and I’ll do that at the appropriate time, but I feel very good and according to the doctor very good shape.
--
Donald Trump: (48:38)
I told you. I told you. He understood very well. I appreciate your understanding.
--
Donald Trump: (48:42)
It’s called the Constitution of the United States and I’d rather have if possible, the governors to make the decision. If a decision was very necessary, and they have done a good job and Tony said it better than anybody. They are doing what we’re asking them to do without having to put the seal on it. But I will say if I thought it was necessary, I’ll do it in a heartbeat.
--
Donald Trump: (49:09)
Opening what?
--
Donald Trump: (49:11)
I haven’t seen, I’m going to have to see to what extent, I’m going to have to see how many people you’re talking about. Are they crowded? Are they packed? Are they not packed? We’ll have to take a look at it. Right now it’s very early for beaches in Georgia, so right now very early, so I’ll take a look at it. He’s done a very good job as the governor. He knows what he’s doing, but we’ll have to take a look. It really does depend on how crowded it may be, but I will talk to him and I will ask him that question. I would ask him. Yes please.
--
Donald Trump: (49:44)
We’re looking at it and the airlines have been cutting their routes. You saw that yesterday. They announced big cuts in routes. We need some some flights for emergency use for military people. We need some flights for medical people. And there are very few flights as you know, and the flights that are going out I think they said they’re 3% to 4% full. You have 3% of the plane that’s occupied, so they’re generally very, very empty planes.
--
Donald Trump: (50:16)
But it’s good to have. it’s a tiny amount of flights relative to the overall. And we need them also for medical workers. Otherwise we’re going to have to do a whole big thing with our own planes. So they’re done for a reason. There’s also testing done when people get onto those planes and also when people get off the planes.
--
Donald Trump: (50:48)
It still could be her opinion. When was she appointed? When was she appointed?
--
Donald Trump: (50:53)
Will you do me a favor.
--
Donald Trump: (50:55)
No, no, no. Let me know now. I have to know now, John. Let me know now because we are doing an incredible job in testing. We are doing a better job than anybody in the world right now in testing. There’s nobody close and other nations admit this. Other nations have admitted it very strongly. Other nations are calling us wanting to know about our testing. Let me know when she was appointed, would you?
--
Donald Trump: (51:19)
Okay, thank you very much. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (51:44)
Looks like a statement more than a question.
--
Donald Trump: (52:00)
We just signed a trade deal. It’s the biggest deal probably ever made and I hope they’re going to honor that trade deal. If they don’t honor the trade deal, then I’ll tell you a different answer, but I think they will. They’re going to spend billions of dollars for agriculture. They’re going to spend billions of dollars for many different things. Whereas China never spent money in our country. We spent money. We had a deficit, a trade deficit with China for years of $500 billion, $400 billion. We had the biggest trade deficits in the history of the world with China. Now China has agreed to spend $250 billion, many billions of dollars in our country. Much of it going to farmers and manufacturers. So I’ll let you know.
--
Donald Trump: (52:48)
I hope they’re going to honor the deal. We’ll find out.
--
Donald Trump: (52:52)
I don’t know. Who are you working for? China? You work for China? Are you with a newspaper? Who are you with?
--
Donald Trump: (52:59)
Who owns that? China. Is it owned by China?
--
Donald Trump: (53:02)
Is it owned by the state?
--
Donald Trump: (53:06)
Okay, good. Look, I’ll let you know. I’ll give you a good answer to that in a few months. I wanted to just see what they do. Because it’s time for them to help us. It’s time right now for China to help us and hopefully they do. And if they don’t that’s okay too. But we signed a deal. It was signed with great goodwill and spirit and it’s time that our farmers benefited, our manufacturers benefited, and we’ll see whether or not that deal is honored.
--
Donald Trump: (53:36)
And I think it will be because I know president Xi who I like and respect, and I think he will honor the deal he made with us. It just went into effect four days ago. I will see whether or not… In fact, I called up just a little while ago, I said, “How are the farmers doing with respect to China? Are they buying the product as anticipated?” And the answer was “yeah, I think so,” but it wasn’t the most positive but it was starting. The deal just started. So I’ll let you know. But for many, many years China ate our lunch because we had people in this position that I’m in right now that allowed China to get away with absolute murder and it should have never happened. But we are now dealing with China. We’ll see what happens.
--
Donald Trump: (54:27)
Wait, how many do you want to ask?
--
Donald Trump: (54:35)
We’re going to take a look at it. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (54:38)
Don’t interrupt.
--
Donald Trump: (54:50)
I can’t tell you, but I know it goes out very quickly once the loan applications approved. And the process is very fast and you have to understand these are banks and this is what they do, but they were swamped. They were actually swamped. Okay, go ahead.

Donald Trump: (55:11)
Put the slide up again please.
--
Donald Trump: (55:18)
Are you ready? Are you ready? Hospitals can do their own testing also. States can do their own testing. States, they’re supposed to be doing testing. Hospitals as opposed to be doing testing. Do you understand that? We’re the federal government. Listen, we’re the federal government. We’re not supposed to stand on street corners doing testing. They go to doctors, they go to hospitals, they go to the state. The state is a more localized government. You have 50 of them and they can go… you also have territories as you know.
--
Donald Trump: (55:49)
And they do the testing and if you look at the chart, if you take a look, did they put it up? Yeah, just take a look. And these are testing, and the results are now coming in very quickly. Initially speaking, the tests were old, obsolete and not really prepared. We have a brand new testing system that we developed very quickly and that’s your result. And you should say, congratulations. Great job. Instead of being so horrid in the way you ask a question, please go ahead. I’d love to have the Admiral speak to that question. Yes.
--
Donald Trump: (58:32)
How long has that person been in government?
--
Donald Trump: (58:37)
Oh, you didn’t tell me that. Oh, I see. You didn’t tell me that, John. You didn’t tell me that. Did serve in the previous admin. You mean the Obama administration? Thank you for telling me that. See, there’s a typical fake news deal.
--
Donald Trump: (58:53)
You’re a third rate reporter and what you just said is a disgrace. You asked me, you said, “sir, just got appointed.” Take a look at what you said now. I said, “When did this person, how long in government?” Well, it was appointed in the Obama administration. Thank you very much, John. Thank you very much. You will never make it. Go ahead please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:00:21)
It’s about 9,000, just so you understand. It’s about 9,000. And by the way, you didn’t tell me you also that this inspector general came out of the Obama administration. You didn’t tell me that. Okay, please go ahead. [crosstalk 01:00:37].
--
Donald Trump: (01:00:49)
No, I understood his views before the call.
--
Donald Trump: (01:00:53)
I just think he’s very nice. I think he’s a nice man. I’ve always thought he was a nice man. I don’t know him. I don’t know if I ever spoke to him before other than to say hello, but I think he’s a nice man. We had a very nice call.
--
Donald Trump: (01:01:09)
No, not really. We’re doing a great job. Hey, I inherited, we this administration. We inherited a broken system both militarily, but we’ve rebuilt our military. We now have so much ammunition where as you remember it, very important, general said, “sir, we have no ammunition.” They wanted to save money on ammunition. They didn’t want to save money because they spent money like nobody ever spent money. But you know what? We now have a great military rebuilt. We have so much ammunition. We don’t know what to do with it. Okay. And that’s a nice feeling to have.
--
Donald Trump: (01:01:41)
But they also gave us empty cupboards. The cupboard was bare. You’ve heard the expression, the cupboard was bare. So we took over a stockpile with a cupboard was bare and where the testing system was broken and old and we redid it and frankly it would be okay for a small event but not for a big event and they had a chance to do it.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:00)
Somebody said that a certain person, I won’t tell you, but a certain person said this will happen and that’s true. The problem is that person never did anything about it. Previous administrations, in previous… they never did anything about it. We all know all about pandemics and all of the things that we’re seeing now, but nobody thought it was going to happen. And if we did think it was going to happen, the problem is nobody did anything about it. We did.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:26)
We have rebuilt the system and now we’re a fine tuned machine. We built thousands of hotel beds for New York. We moved a ship in that now we’re going to make for COVID-19. We’re going to make it so that people having this horrible thing happen to them will be able to use the ship. The ship, as I said, is going to be shared with New Jersey, New York and New Jersey.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:48)
We’ve done things that are incredible. When you build, what was it, 18 hospitals. We built 18 hospitals. We built medical centers all over the country and when you have Gavin Newsom and other governors who really have been very nice and generous in their statements because they make the statements to the press, not just to my face. Others tell us how great we’re doing. Like the call that Mike had today. I heard from other people that were on the call. He said it was incredible. It was two hours and everything was positive. They were so happy with what we’ve done and we’re ready to do more if they need it because we’re ready to march.
--
Donald Trump: (01:03:23)
The admiral can tell you we are sitting there with 9,000 ventilators and we’re ready to march. When we see that we can move very quickly. As soon as we see that need, we can move very quickly. We’re ready to march. We built a great system. The problem is the Democrats, like a guy like Chuck Schumer’s a total lightweight, by the way, I’ve known him for a long time. He’ll say, “Why don’t you put a military man in charge?” Military man, I have all military man. This man is doing an incredible job. We have two admirals, numerous generals. We have the Army Corps of Engineers, we have FEMA.
--
Donald Trump: (01:04:02)
We have this whole force like nobody’s ever seen before. We have a great military operation, and they’ve done an incredible job. And honestly people should respect because nobody’s ever seen anything like what we’ve done. And what they end up with… Thinking about me, don’t worry about me. I will only get bad. If I say, “How many ventilators do you need, governor?” “1,000 would be great.” I said, “No, I’m going to send you 10,000.” And then you’ll call up from the media. You’ll say, “How did Trump do?” “We’re not happy. He didn’t send us enough ventilators.”
--
Donald Trump: (01:04:36)
Because that’s called politics, but if you look at what’s happening, and I’m even surprised. The governors are saying all good things, but the Democrat governors and a couple of RINOs, frankly they’re RINOs, that’s all they are. One RINO in particular. But the governors are saying great things. He had a call that lasted two hours today. I heard about that called not just from Mike. It was a perfect call. Now I’m sure you were on the call even though you’re not supposed to be. I’m sure you were on the call, meaning some of the media was on the call because they’re constantly reporting the call. If they’re honest, they will say it was a great call. Okay. Okay, next question, please. Here we go.
--
Donald Trump: (01:05:32)
We’re never going to do anything that hurts Texas.
--
Donald Trump: (01:05:35)
We’re only helping Texas. By the way, the governor is doing a great job over there with this situation, and Texas is so big. You have some parts of the state that are affected. Other parts that aren’t affected at all. It’s an incredible place.
--
Donald Trump: (01:05:54)
We’re going to use whatever we need and we’re doing it totally in conjunction with the governor. We’re doing it in conjunction with your Texas governor who’s done a fantastic job.
--
Donald Trump: (01:06:16)
Very few people are coming through our border and you’ll be happy to know, we’re up to mile 161 of the wall.
--
Donald Trump: (01:06:24)
Oh, I see, okay. But on the border between Mexico, we have 161 miles of wall.
--
Donald Trump: (01:06:39)
First, you want us to call eight governors and tell them to do something, and then you’re complaining that another governor is so strict that he actually checks the borders. I understand why he’s doing that because he knows who he has and he doesn’t want people coming in if they should maybe not be to the liking of the doctors. [crosstalk 01:07:01] No, I think, look, he’s done a great job. He’s done a great job with this case as have many other governors. But he’s done a great job. One of the things I thought you were going to say is we’ve been very tough on our southern border as you know. Very, very tough and part of that’s because of the fact that we have so much… when you talk about 160 miles of new wall, nobody’s coming through that. Nobody, not even close. And we’re building it rapidly. We will have early next year we’ll have close to 500 miles of wall, which is what our goal was.
--
Donald Trump: (01:07:45)
I don’t know necessarily, but I certainly want to listen, and what I want to do is two things. A real infrastructure, not a green new deal. The carbon footprint. I’m not looking for the carbon footprint. We want to put people to work. And frankly, for so many years, we’ve let our infrastructure go.
--
Donald Trump: (01:08:03)
Frankly, for so many years, we’ve let our infrastructure go to hell because we were wasting all our money in the Middle East and other places. Okay? I want to rebuild our country. I don’t want to rebuild that. We’re tired. We’ve rebuilt, if you call it that, or destroyed, frankly, what we’ve done is so crazy. What we have done, the direction that this country has taken is so sad, but we’re in the Middle East for $8 trillion, and if you want to fix a pothole in a highway, you can’t do it because they don’t want to give you the funds. So, we want to have an infrastructure bill, a real one like in the vicinity of $2 trillion to completely rebuild our roads, our bridges, our highways, our tunnels, everything. I’m totally open to listening to that. I’m also open to listening to, and even putting forward, because we are going to be putting something forward, more money for our citizens because they’ve gone through a trauma.
--
Donald Trump: (01:08:56)
This has been trauma. This came out of nowhere. I say it and I’ll say it again, we had the greatest economy in the history of the world. We had the most people working in the history of our country, almost 160 million people, far more than ever before, and then one day our professionals correctly came to us and they said, “Sorry sir, we have to close down our country.” And I said, “Say it again, say it again.” “We have to close down our country,” and the entire world closed down because of this hidden enemy. Now we are going to take good care of our people. It was not their fault.
--
Donald Trump: (01:09:41)
Yes, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:11:44)
You did not get there.
--
Donald Trump: (01:11:46)
Good, I’m very happy about that.
--
Donald Trump: (01:11:54)
Your grandson’s okay?
--
Donald Trump: (01:11:57)
That’s a lot of temperature, would have thought.
--
Donald Trump: (01:12:53)
Thank you, Deborah. And it is making a big difference. I saw where Governor Cuomo was a little bit upset today over the weekend, a lot of people outside and they were pretty big groups of people. I saw that. I noticed that and he wasn’t happy with that, and I could understand that. Look, we have a period, a short period of time, hopefully it’s a short period of time to go, and let’s get it done. Let’s get it done. Kristin, did you have a question?
--
Donald Trump: (01:13:16)
You’re so quiet today.
--
Donald Trump: (01:13:19)
It’s because you have your own show.
--
Donald Trump: (01:13:37)
Well, I was opposed to the way of money distribution through, as you know, unemployment, and through the state offices, because they have very old, not all of them, but many of them have 40 year old equipment as I’ve said, and it makes it very difficult. But that’s what they want to do. That’s the way it’s mandated to do. I thought it would be better if we did a direct payment system, but the Democrats really wanted it, and I think they had some help from a couple of people that I would have, had I spoken to them, I would have convinced them otherwise, I really believe. But it’s getting out and the federal government has done its job. All we could do is give this massive amount of money to the states. The states then are responsible to distribute it a little bit like we’re talking about here, but the money will be right on time from the federal government.
--
Donald Trump: (01:14:25)
Then the states have to do their job in getting it out.
--
Donald Trump: (01:14:30)
We could very well do a second round of direct. I would do it direct.
--
Donald Trump: (01:14:35)
It is absolutely under serious consideration.
--
Donald Trump: (01:14:50)
But we have people that are so talented. I know the people he suggested. They’re wonderful people. They worked here. They’re wonderful people. He’s just doing that because it’s politics because you know what-
--
Donald Trump: (01:15:01)
We have many depending on what. In terms of testing, this gentleman right here. You know who the point person is? This gentleman right here. He’s the one in charge of the task force. But Mike, you may want to tell him about the… Because this is really a military operation.
--
Donald Trump: (01:18:30)
Thank you. And Kristen, when Schumer makes a statement like that, he’s only doing it for politics. He knows. We have the best generals, the best admirals, we have the best people. These are incredible leaders. These are vibrant people. They’ve done such a good job. And again, you’ll get a tape of the conversation, because I’m sure some of the governors probably had their favorite reporter listening to the conversation, even though they weren’t supposed to, but that’s happened before. Just so you understand, we had a call today that was a beautiful call, everybody friendly, everybody happy. They also know in some cases we’ll get them a little bit more, and if they need it, we’ll get them a lot more depending on where this monster is going. But when Schumer does that, [crosstalk 01:19:16] take a look at the past… Well, you’re going to have to tell me who. [crosstalk 01:19:19]
--
Donald Trump: (01:19:21)
Well, yeah, some Democrats, because they view this as a campaign issue. They want to make Trump look as bad as they can because they want to try and win an election that they shouldn’t be allowed to win based on the fact that we have done a great job. We built the greatest economy in the world. I’ll do it a second time. We got artificially stopped by a virus that nobody ever thought possible, and we’ve handled it, and we’ve built a team and we’ve built an apparatus that’s been unbelievable. Take a look at the Swine Flu, right? That’s H1N1. Take a look at that, and it’s not the other way around, by the way, it’s H1N1. Take a look. You know what I mean by that. Take a look at the Swine Flu. It was a disaster. 17,000 people died. The other administration, they didn’t even know.
--
Donald Trump: (01:20:07)
It was like they didn’t even know it was here, and that was peanuts compared to what we have in terms of the power and the magnitude of what we’re going through. This is attacking 182 countries simultaneously. So Schumer’s just all about politics. I’ve known him almost all of my adult life, and he’s a disgrace. In many ways he’s a disgrace, and he knows it’s done. He just wants to do that. But he knows the job we’re doing. Everybody’s amazed at the job we’re doing, and the public is starting to find out. One of the reasons I do these news conferences, because if I didn’t, they would believe fake news, and we can’t let them believe fake news. They see us up here. They see us with admirals. They see us with this talent. They see the job that Mike Pence has done, which has been an unbelievable job, an unbelievable job. I put him there. I thought he’d do well. He did great as the Governor of Indiana, and I thought Mike would do well. He’s done much better than well, and he gets along with people I think much better than I do, because I like people being 100. Mike can put up with things that sometimes I say it’s amazing that he can put up with it, but he’s done an incredible job, and so has the entire team. This is a military operation, and again, we built 2,900 beds in Javits Center. We built medical centers in New York. In Chicago, we built a thousand beds much more now in McCormick Place. That’s their big convention home, the equivalent of Javits, conventional home, big McCormick Place, fantastic place. By the way, the mayor of Chicago, at least on the phone, is extremely happy with what we’re doing, thanking us, has a great relationship with Mike, thanking us, and I just wish the politicians would say to you what they say to us, really, and it’s a good question. Do you have one? Yeah, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:22:25)
You said Latin America?
--
Donald Trump: (01:22:32)
It’s a good question. We’ve moved a tremendous number of boats and ships to the area of, different areas of exactly where you’re talking about, because we’re tired of drugs pouring into our country from other places, and we’re tired of seeing drugs pouring into different parts of Latin America, South America, and just coming into our country. Now we’ve got them stopped at the border and they’re trying to do it by sea. So we stop them at the border with, and frankly with the help of Mexico. Mexico right now has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border. They never had any soldiers. They’re doing that because I’ve asked them to do it. That’s the only reason they’re doing it. They have 27,000 soldiers. So now they’re trying to bring it in by boat and by ship, the drug Lords and the people doing drugs, and trying to destroy our country from inside with drugs, and we’re hitting them very, very hard, and that’s why we’re doing it.
--
Donald Trump: (01:23:30)
Say it.
--
Donald Trump: (01:23:34)
Well, there are the activities of human trafficking, and especially with respect to women, and as you know, proportionally, it’s mostly women, and it’s a horrible thing. [crosstalk 01:23:46] It’s a horrible thing and there’s never been a time like it, and it’s because of the internet, and this is all over the world. But for the most part they’re coming through, in this country. they’re coming through the southern border, but we’re hitting them very hard. They have tremendous illegal trafficking in women and children also, but mostly in women. And it’s illegal, and it’s horrible, and it’s disgraceful, and I’ve seen things that are an absolute disgrace, and we’re trying to knock them out and we’re knocking them hard. And again, I want to thank the President of Mexico because he has really stepped up to the plate, 27,000 soldiers. They’ve never had any soldiers at our border, and I did that because the Democrats will not approve anything to stop because they want to have open borders.
--
Donald Trump: (01:24:31)
They want to have all these people flowing through our border and in many cases they’re sick. They have problems that you don’t want to know about, or they’re criminals in many cases, not in all cases, but in many cases. They want to have open borders. They want to have sanctuary cities, so they protect criminals, and I don’t want to have it, and Joe Biden does want to have that also, as you know, because he said that during numerous debates. I want to have strong borders and I don’t like protecting criminals with sanctuary cities, but we’re doing it for drugs, we’re doing it for human trafficking, we’re doing it because you have to do it. We either have borders or we don’t have a country. [crosstalk 01:25:11] All right. Go ahead, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:25:29)
I have an answer but I’d rather have the Admiral answer that.
--
Donald Trump: (01:28:41)
Which nobody else can do, by the way. No other country can do.
--
Donald Trump: (01:28:44)
I’ll just give you one example. It would be very important to know if the virus is still circulating here, whether for example a healthcare worker, or a longterm care nursing home worker is immune from the virus and can’t carry it. Very, very important to protect our elderly in that situation. But also if you haven’t been exposed to make sure that you really take precautions, and maybe take care of the people who don’t have the virus and you don’t have the virus. So it’s complex, but it’s not complicated on how you go about looking this in different segments of society. And I don’t want to take too much more time with the podium, but antibody tests are a different thing. They’re coming. We’re highly confident that this can be scaled very rapidly and provide us a bit of information we just don’t have now.
--
Donald Trump: (01:29:30)
[inaudible 00:21:31], be a bad week.
--
Donald Trump: (01:29:36)
Yeah, I’m going to look into it. And I also think our Navy Secretary is a highly respected man. So sometimes that happens with people and I’ll take a look at it.
--
Donald Trump: (01:29:50)
When he sends a letter out and he sends copies all over the place and it’s not a classified letter, and it was very disconcerting to the families of the people on the, very disconcerting, so number one, they get worried and scared. It was weak. We don’t want weak, but I’m going to take a look because I think he looks to me like he’s an outstanding guy. I looked at his whole, just a little while ago, I looked at his file, and people have bad days and we’ll take a look at it.
--
Donald Trump: (01:30:27)
Well, we’ll take a look. I want to look. I want to speak also to the Secretary. I also want to speak to the Secretary of Defense, who is Mark Esper, who’s doing a fantastic job, and maybe I can help the situation out. I mean, you guys are saying why is the President getting involved and going, well, I like to solve problems. It’s a problem. I don’t want to see men hurt, women hurt, I don’t want to see people hurt unnecessarily. Maybe we can solve it easily where it’s not life changing. But he did, he did a bad thing. Sending a letter out and many, many copies, as you know. I don’t know. I heard 28 copies. I heard a lot. That’s a lot of copies. Plus, the letter was five pages long. I haven’t read the letter, but I think it was five pages long, single spaced. That’s a lot of writing. He’s the captain of a ship. He’s a very important person of a very expensive ship, a nuclear powered ship. He shouldn’t be writing letters like that, but it happens. Sometimes I’ll write a letter that I say, ” I wish I didn’t send it.” Not too often, but it happens. [crosstalk 01:31:34] Go ahead. Yes.
--
Donald Trump: (01:31:52)
Well, I don’t want to comment on what he said. I understand.
--
Donald Trump: (01:31:55)
It’s tough language, but let’s not get into that. It’s tough language. Now there are some people that think, “Oh wow. He says it like it is.” Look, he made a mistake. He should not have sent that letter, or he should’ve gone through his chain of command, which is the typical way of doing it. He’s in the military. He’s a very important person in the military. He knows it better than anybody in this room, what he should’ve done, and I’m sure he feels he made a mistake, but I’m going to look into it, and I’m going to see, maybe we can do something because I’m not looking to destroy a person’s life who’s had an otherwise stellar career as I understand it. I looked at this file just now because I’ve been seeing what’s going on. If we can save a person’s career…
--
Donald Trump: (01:32:42)
I don’t mind going after a person that they did something wrong, but this was a mistake. He made a mistake. I’m not justifying what he did. He made a mistake. Shouldn’t be sending letters. He’s the captain. He’s a very important person in the military. You don’t send letters and then it leaks into a newspaper, of all newspapers, that was a beauty, right? So you just don’t do that. So it was a mistake, but I may get involved. I’ll call Secretary of Defense and find out a little bit about it, and if I can help two people, two good people, I’m going to help them.
--
Donald Trump: (01:33:18)
Say it.
--
Donald Trump: (01:33:22)
With the captain?
--
Donald Trump: (01:33:26)
I said, when you asked me, and when the question was asked the last time, I said, “He shouldn’t have sent the letter.: I haven’t changed. He should not have sent a letter. And if there’s a letter, it should go classified and it should go to his superior, and he shouldn’t be jumping off the superior. [crosstalk 01:33:39] It hasn’t changed in that regard. The only thing that has played right up here with me is that I looked at his record and he’s been an outstanding person. If he wasn’t, I wouldn’t even be talking about this. He’s been an outstanding person. He’s had a very exemplary military career. I mean, he started off as a helicopter pilot. They called him Chopper. His name was Chopper. He was a great helicopter pilot. It’s a tremendous skill. I know a lot about helicopters. And then he went F-16s or F-18s and he was a tremendous pilot.
--
Donald Trump: (01:34:15)
And then he’s very smart. He studied nuclear energy and he was fantastic, and very few people have the aptitude, they have the mentality to do that. Nuclear energy is very complex. It’s very hard. Very few people can do it. And he did it well, and then it became the captain of a nuclear ship, right, replacement cost, if you look at replacement cost, $18 billion are replacement costs, right? So he’s got, on a replacement cost basis, an $18 billion ship. You know the President Gerald Ford, very expensive, that’s the nearest thing I can think of, but they’re spending money on that one like nobody’s ever seen. So he made a mistake. He made a mistake, and maybe we’re going to make that mistake, not destroy his life. Okay, a couple of more. [crosstalk 01:35:08] Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:35:25)
Very much in my mind.
--
Donald Trump: (01:35:28)
There doesn’t have to be a phase four. I think it could be a separate phase when it’s all over. Right now, I don’t think they want to think of it. These people don’t want to think about. These people are incredible. They’re not thinking about how much am I getting paid? These people are incredible. I’ve seen it. I see their spirit. I hear about it all the time from Mike, from the Admiral, I hear about it all the time. These people are incredible. When it’s all over, I do want to seriously think, maybe in the form of bonuses. These people are, what they’ve done is incredible. I just admire the attitude and I’ve said it. They walk into those hospitals and they are seriously, you know, one of the things that came up with the Comfort, the ship, is that when we fulfill the request of Governor Cuomo and Governor Murphy, and they’re going to be splitting up, but a lot of things happen to ships when you do that.
--
Donald Trump: (01:36:22)
They didn’t want to do this. In fact, they specifically didn’t want to do this, have patients that were affected with this horrible disease, or whatever the plague, because frankly it’s a plague. That’s exactly what it is. You’d read about it in the old days, the plague, and that’s exactly what it is. But we’re doing it. But when I see the bravery of these people walking through doors without their stuff, they’re not standing outside, “Hey, let’s get ready.” They’re running through doors putting on the stuff. It’s not even on. I think it’s incredible. I’m telling you, the nearest thing I can think of is soldiers in battle, and soldiers going right into battle, because that’s what they’re doing. It’s really, in many ways, it’s the same thing. All right. How about one more?
--
Donald Trump: (01:37:22)
I hope it’s rescheduled. I hope football is able to start. I hope baseball can get to play a little bit. I hope basketball can maybe do their playoffs. I mean, hey, I have no interests or anything other than I want what’s good for the country.
--
Donald Trump: (01:37:38)
A lot of people are tired of looking at games that are five years old. I looked the other day, I saw somebody, I said, “Wow, he looks great.” I forgot. I said, “Oh, that was nine years ago.” I said, “He’s really in great shape.” Well, not in great shape now, but he was in great shape then. It was nine years ago. You get tired of looking at nine year old baseball games and playoff games that took place 12 years ago. I don’t have much time to do that, frankly, but that’s what people are doing, and they want to see sports. Sports are a great thing for this country and I hope football can start, and I told them, I think you might be able to. They may very well be able to. I hope they can start and I hope they can start with people in the stands.

Donald Trump: (01:38:14)
You know, we’re not going to be separated. You have seats. Those seats are meant for people to sit next to each other, and when this virus is gone, people are going to be sitting next to each other, and just for the restaurant industry so they understand, when the virus is gone, people are going to be sitting next to each other. One man said, “I have a 200 seat restaurant. It’s been great. But if I go by these rules, those 200 seats goes down to 60.” I said, “No, no. You have a 200 seat restaurant. That’s what you have.” But we have to wait until the virus goes away. It wouldn’t even do well at 60. Frankly, there’s a warmth to it also. There’s a warmth. But not when we have the virus in the air.
--
Donald Trump: (01:38:54)
Well ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. I’m going to let our Vice President take over. He’s got some really interesting numbers, statistics, and I want to thank the Admiral. I want to thank Tony and Deborah and everybody else. I want to thank everybody that’s working, and I really do, I see a lot of tremendous things happen. The therapeutics, the call I had today was one of the most exciting calls I’ve had in a long time. And again, I want to wish my best to the UK and the family of Boris Johnson, and we just hope he’s going to be okay because he’s a fine guy. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (00:24)
Thank you very much everybody, and good afternoon. Today’s Good Friday and this Sunday, millions of Christians celebrate Easter and the resurrection of Jesus Christ. At this holy time, we pray that God will heal the sick and comfort the heartbroken and bless our heroes. As American families look forward to Easter, we’re reminded that our story ends not in despair, but in triumph and renewal.
--
Donald Trump: (00:58)
Very appropriate, isn’t it? I’d like to provide Americans an update on our ongoing efforts in the war against the invisible enemy. Before I do that, I’ll have a couple of notes. The United States in discussions last night with Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and in dealing with OPEC nations, we are trying to get Mexico, as the expression goes, over the barrel, and Mexico is committing to do a hundred thousand fewer barrels. President and I spoke last night, we have a great relationship, great friendship. They’re helping us very much at the border.
--
Donald Trump: (01:40)
They have 27,000 soldiers, Mexican soldiers on our border right now, stopping people from coming into our country as our wall goes up. We’re up to about 168 miles of wall. And in speaking with the president, they have a limit. The OPEC nations have agreed to a different limit reduction of about 23%. So what I thought I would do, and I don’t know that it’s going to be accepted, we’ll find out, the United States will help Mexico along and they’ll reimburse us sometime at a later date when they’re prepared to do so.
--
Donald Trump: (02:19)
And we had a great conversation, but we’ll find out how that all works out. As you know, they’re trying to get rid of the glut of oil. There’s a tremendous glut of oil and we don’t want anything to hurt our incredible industry, actually the largest producer in the world now. So we don’t want anything to hurt those jobs, those great jobs in Texas and North Dakota and Oklahoma and everywhere.
--
Donald Trump: (02:43)
We have a tremendous energy, New Mexico, tremendous energy business, and we want to keep those jobs. So we’re working on it. I think eventually it’s going to work out, may work out quicker than what most people thought possible and maybe it won’t, but it’ll work out eventually. Our experts are monitoring the data from every part of our country having to do with the topic that we’re here to discuss.
--
Donald Trump: (03:13)
In the midst of grief and pain, we’re seeing clear signs that our aggressive strategy is saving countless lives. A tremendous progress is being made. Although when you look at some of the numbers, I just spoke with Governor Cuomo, we had a good talk. When you look at those numbers, the numbers of death, people that have died, it’s so horrible. Now, on the other side, you have the numbers of beds being used. We’re just saying are substantially reduced.
--
Donald Trump: (03:48)
That’s usually the sign that it’s heading in the downward curve. So New York, we know where that is, but in the midst of all this grief and this pain, we’re seeing these signs and we’re seeing them very strongly, and a lot of that has to do with the aggressive strategy in saving so many lives. We’re saving so many lives compared to what it could have been. So nobody knows what the number is, but we had a number of 100,000 lives, as many as that is, it’s impossible to even think of it. And that was the low end with a tremendous amount of work and a tremendous amount of… you can call it many different things. Our people had to be extremely strong and brave to be able to put up with what they’ve put up with. But the minimum, if you did this social distancing and every other aspect, and I think I can say 90% maybe even more than that were able to do it.
--
Donald Trump: (04:55)
The minimum number was 100,000 lives and I think we’ll be substantially under that number. Hard to believe that if you had 60,000, you can never be happy, but that’s a lot fewer than we were originally told and thinking. So they said between 100,000 and 220,000 lives on the minimum side and then up to 2.2 million lives if we didn’t do anything.
--
Donald Trump: (05:22)
But it showed just tremendous resolve by the people of this country. So we’ll see what it ends up being, but it looks like we’re headed to a number of substantially below the 100,000 that would be the low mark and I hope that bears out. The situation in Detroit and New Orleans appears to be stabilizing. Detroit is really started to go up and now it is stabilizing and New Orleans is a great place. I have so many friends there. They can’t believe what’s happening, but it’s really stabilized.
--
Donald Trump: (05:58)
I spoke with the governor of Louisiana and as you know, we’re building them additional beds right now, the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA. And that is going to be done and I hope they’re not going to be very well used because I think they’ve really… I don’t think they’re going to need them or certainly not very many of them. We built them a big hospital of a thousand beds and now we’re in the midst of doing another thousand. I don’t think they’re going to be using very many of them and that’s a good thing.
--
Donald Trump: (06:29)
There was a time, two weeks ago when we said, that’s not going to be nearly enough. We’re going to have to build more, but we wanted to wait to see, and I’m glad we waited. It just looks like they’re doing really well. Louisiana and state of Michigan is doing really much better than we thought. In Washington State, we’ve made enough progress that the governor’s now able to return an army field hospital, so we’re going to take that hospital. We don’t think we need any more hospitals. We built thousands of beds all over the country and we think we’re probably not going to need that hospital anywhere.
--
Donald Trump: (07:07)
If we do, we’re ready to move it to a different location. In New York, we’re seeing hospital admissions declining very substantially. As I said in nationwide, the number of new cases per day is flattening, substantially suggesting that we’re near the peak and our comprehensive strategy is working. Over time, our guidelines to slow the spread are decreasing the rate of new cases very substantially and will result in fewer hospital admissions and we’re seeing that. It’s incredible.
--
Donald Trump: (07:39)
I think with no exceptions, it’s looking like it’s lower. And again that’s because of the people doing what they had to do. Great people and working with elected representatives and the doctors, the nurses and everybody. I mean just everybody has been so amazing.
--
Donald Trump: (08:04)
I was told this morning again, please mention all of those people working in the grocery stores and it’s true, the checkouts and the clerks and the people that are really… and a number of those people have become infected. So we want to thank them and a shout out to them. With the tireless devotion of American doctors and nurses and all of the medical people, we’ve kept our fatality rate very, very low compared to other countries.
--
Donald Trump: (08:35)
My administration’s closely monitoring the data on the viruses impact on our cherished African American communities because they’ve been hit hard and the surgeon general will be sharing more of that information right after we’re finished here. He’ll be coming up and saying exactly what’s happening because it’s really, it’s very troublesome I will tell you that. I’d also like to provide clarity on the important point for many Americans on elective surgeries. Well, we’ve asked hospitals to cancel surgeries and procedures that do not take place at this time, just not to do them now.
--
Donald Trump: (09:15)
The choice to delay any treatment still remains between the patient and their doctor. We’re not advising Americans to postpone medical treatment that their doctor believes should occur now, so it’s different kinds of surgery obviously, but we’re really getting to the point where you can start to think about doing that surgery if necessary, pretty soon, I think pretty soon.
--
Donald Trump: (09:39)
Yesterday I directed Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue to expedite aid to American farmers and Secretary Perdue will be using all of the tools at his disposal to develop a program and very quickly of at least $16 billion to provide relief for farmers, ranchers, and producers impacted by the coronavirus. In this time of crisis, we must keep our supply chains moving from the beginning, right from beginning to end and we’re committed to supporting the amazing men and women who produce supply. I did last night a statement on social media and I said, “I have directed Secretary Sonny Perdue to expedite, help to our farmers, especially to the smaller farmers who are very, very badly hurting right now.
--
Donald Trump: (10:31)
I expect Secretary Perdue to use all of the funds and authorities at his disposal to make sure that our food supply is stable and safe and our great farmers are prosperous and continue to be prosperous. We’re working very hard to make sure our food supply chain is sound and plentiful, but we all know that that begins with our farmers, cattlemen, ranchers and producers.”
--
Donald Trump: (10:56)
So we’re going to be working with these small farmers, the big farmers, the cattlemen, the ranchers, all of the producers. We’re going to take care of them. We’re working with them right now. We have a lot of money that was put there through our use of tariffs and other means and we’re going to help out our farmers. And I don’t think… I’ll tell you, I’ve been helping our farmers for a couple of years because they were targeted as you know, by China and others and I think they’re very grateful for what we’ve done. On the medical front, the FDA has issued 47 emergency use authorizations for advancements and testing, new ventilator designs, innovations and personal protective equipment and experimental medicines. And Dr. Hahn’s going to be talking about that. We’ve cut through the red tape to give doctors and patients unprecedented freedom to make their own healthcare decisions, granting access to potential therapies and drugs. Since Monday, we’ve deployed two major shipments of Hydroxychloroquine from our national stockpile and it’s going to various cities. And we are also disposing and getting as quickly as we can, portions of it to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense. And speaking of the Department of Defense, they’re going to be sending us 10,000,095 masks that they had and we’re in great shape in every way. We’re in great shape with ventilators. We’re in great shape with protective clothing. We have additional plane loads coming in, but we’re not getting any calls from governors at this moment. I can speak, I think for Vice President Pence will be talking in a little while.
--
Donald Trump: (12:48)
We’re getting very few calls from governors or anybody else needing anything. They’re in great shape for this surge that’s coming in, certain areas in particular and that’s a good job. You’ve done a great job on that, Mike, really a great job. I appreciate it. The whole country appreciates it.
--
Donald Trump: (13:06)
More than 2 million coronavirus tests have now been completed and we’re conducting approximately 100,000 more every day. We’re also working to bring blood-based Serology tests to the market as quickly as possible so that Americans can determine whether or not they have already had the virus and potentially have immunity. They have immunity if they’ve had the virus. A lot of them don’t even know if they’ve added. Sometimes it’s brutal. You see the Prime Minister seems to be doing well now I hope, he had a rough go of it and still is, but he’s doing better.
--
Donald Trump: (13:43)
And then some people don’t even know they had it. It could be sniffles, it could be they don’t feel perfect, but they’ve had it and they’re the lucky ones. The NIH, CDC and FDA are currently validating these antibody tests to ensure that they’re accurate and they’re doing that at breakneck speed. I think we can say that doctor, and we’re going to get them approved very quickly, Dr. Hahns.
--
Donald Trump: (14:09)
When validated, we’re confident that the production will scale up to tens of millions of tests very quickly. We are leading the world now in testing by far and we’re going to keep it that way. Other countries are coming to us and they’re wanting to know about our tests and can they buy the tests and can they do whatever they have to do to get the test. And we’re going to make that very soon. We’ll be in a position to make that possible because it’s important for them to have it.
--
Donald Trump: (14:38)
And we’re going to have an announcement on the World Health Organization sometime next week. As you know, we given them approximately $500 million a year and we’re going to be talking about that subject next week. We’ll have a lot to say about it. We’ll hold it. Every American should be proud of what our country is achieved in just a short period of time. The US Military has deployed thousands of personnel to build 23 temporary hospitals with more than 16,000 beds. And we have the potential to build many more if we needed them. We’re all ready to go, but I don’t think we’re going to need them, which is great. Great news. And we built those hospitals in 12 states and the District of Columbia using the Defense Production Act and we used it like a hammer. A lot of the media said, “Oh, we weren’t using it.”
--
Donald Trump: (15:30)
We used it like a hammer to a point where all we had to do is say the words and everybody gave us max and they’ve done a good job. They really have done a good job with few exceptions. And we’ve harnessed the full power of American industry to produce ventilators and other essential supplies. Right now we’re making thousands of ventilators, many of which we won’t need, but we’ll use them in our stockpile and we’ll build that up. We’ll also help build up the stockpiles, which they should have had in the states.
--
Donald Trump: (16:04)
And so we’re working with governors on that and we’ll also help other countries or countries that are calling us for help. They need ventilators and there are no position to build ventilators. We are, we have Ford and General Motors and many, many companies are building ventilators. So we’re going to be helping at a not too distant point, we’re going to be helping quite a few of the countries.
--
Donald Trump: (16:29)
Now we’ve launched Project Airbridge to deliver nearly 300 million pieces of personal protective equipment from and around the globe. We’re also shipping out 60 sterilization systems to 10 different cities that can each sterilize up to 80,000 masks each day and I’m even hearing it can go up to 120,000 masks a day, certain equipment with certain additions. It’s a company in Ohio that makes it, it’s a great company. Great, I hear it’s a great product. Works very well. I asked that question. I said, “How come we have to buy so many masks? Why can’t we sterilize the masks that are being used?” And the answer was, you can. In this case, they say up to 20 times, so we can take a mask, certain types of masks, the N95s in particular, we can sterilize them, make them very clean up to 20 times. That’s a great thing.
--
Donald Trump: (17:22)
In addition, we passed the largest Emergency Economic Relief Package in American history to save the US economy and protect the American worker. As you know, this past week, which was four active days on the stock market, Good Friday today is not included, the markets are closed. In four days, we had the biggest market increase, stock market increase that we’ve had in 50 years. That tells you that there’s a pent up demand, that tells you they want to get back. There’s something good going to happen. I really believe that, there’s something very good going to happen. We have to get back.
--
Donald Trump: (17:59)
So think of it in this horrible period, this horrible, dark period where this monster came in and worked it’s horrible, horrible spell over the world. 184 countries as of this morning, 184 countries. We’ve done well and I guess the market thinks we’ve done well because we had the biggest stock market increase without one day.
--
Donald Trump: (18:28)
We’re talking four days instead of five that we’ve had in 50 years, 50 years. Think of that, more than 50 years actually. In short, the American people have launched the greatest mobilization of our society since World War II, deploying every scientific, governmental, medical, and military resource to defeat the virus. So I want to just start then with, we’re going to answer questions later. We’ll have time, if we have a lot of time today. A lot of people are off as they should be, Good Friday, but so I’ll stick around. We’ll answer questions later. I want to start with Deborah Birx, please. Dr. Birx and you can go over some of the numbers we just looked at and that’d be great. Thank you very much, Deborah.
--
Donald Trump: (22:59)
Thank you very much, Deborah. Tony, doctor, please.
--
Donald Trump: (33:15)
Thank you very much. Good job, thank you. Mike, please.
--
Donald Trump: (39:20)
Great job. Thank you. Okay. It’s Good Friday. Let’s be nice. Okay, let’s be real nice. Yeah, please go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (39:39)
All of the OPEC nations met and others and they’re all agreeing to cut back because there’s a tremendous glut. We don’t even… We’re filling up our strategic reserves. We don’t even have room to store it and in fact they are using ships to store oil. There’s never been anything like this. It was being overproduced to start off with and then you had the virus and that took off 40% right there. There’s a glut of oil like nobody’s ever seen before. It’s good in many ways and depending on where you are, who you are it’s bad.
--
Donald Trump: (40:10)
We have a tremendous energy business with hundreds of thousands of jobs. We’re doing great. Number one in the world. So they all got together and they said we’re going to cut it because we have to get rid of this tremendous supply. Now the good news is gasoline prices, I’m seeing 90 cents, 85 cents in different parts of the country, a gallon. Nobody’s ever seen that. I guess you have to go back to the 1950s for that. The big large dollar bills. Remember? You don’t remember, you’re too young. But the fact that you have to go back a long ways to see it.
--
Donald Trump: (40:43)
So there’s some good, the airlines are trying to come back, having low fuel costs is good for them and other reasons. Steel manufacturing, but a lot of the steel goes to building what we do for the oil and engineering firms. So that’s a double edged sword. But we want to keep our energy, we want to remain independent. We will remain independent I think regardless, but we want to get rid of this tremendous overflow. There’s no place to even store it.
--
Donald Trump: (41:11)
So the OPEC nations met, they’ve been meeting and I’ve hated OPEC over the years. Absolutely hated them, but obviously it broke down and we potentially have years worth of supply, long time before it ever can catch up even if they do reduce it. And they agreed. But Mexico didn’t agree. It was one of the few countries that didn’t agree. This OPEC plus, these are OPEC plus countries outside. Do you understand? And Mexico didn’t agree. And I understand the president very well. He has a level when he came in and he wanted to keep it at that level. Oil is important for Mexico. The problem is, and I explained it very strongly, you’re going to be selling it for $5 or $10 a barrel, so in the end it’s bad. But he did have some political difficulty with it frankly, and I understand that too. And it’s a small amount for us, it’s a larger amount from Mexico, but it’s a very small amount for the United States being the biggest producer.
--
Donald Trump: (42:08)
So I agreed to pick up some of the slack. So he was going to reduce it by a 100,000 barrels, reduces output by a 100,000 barrels. And I was going to pick up the slack and they would make it up to us at a later date. They would make up what we’re doing at a later date. It could be in a different form. And I don’t know whether or not that’s going to… If Mexico was acceptable, I don’t know whether or not that’s going to be acceptable to the other oil producing nations. We’ll find out. But it’s something that would certainly be acceptable to me to get it over the back.
--
Donald Trump: (42:38)
So Mexico is going to reduce by a 100,000 barrels and that would mean that there are 250 to 300 barrels short. We’d make up the difference. They would reimburse us at a later date.
--
Donald Trump: (42:53)
By cutting some United States. Now the US production had already been cut because we’re a market driven economy and oil is very market driven. They’ve been cutting oil all over the place. We’re cutting it back. And what does it mean really? It means that we have it in the ground, we can use it now. Now we have a lot of ground with a lot of oil in it. I think we’re number one in that too. We’re probably number one, especially with ANWR as I got ANWR approved IN Alaska. That’s one of the biggest finds anywhere in the world. So when you add it all up, I think we’re probably number one even in what we have under.
--
Donald Trump: (43:26)
We’re very lucky. We grew up in a land that was rich in a lot of ways, but it’s also rich because it has a lot of oil underneath, oil and gas. And as natural gas, LNG is all over the country now at a very low price. And our carbon, our atmosphere, the level of environmental cleanliness is at it’s all time best right now. All time best. Because we are using a lot of natural gas.
--
Donald Trump: (43:55)
But we have many forms of energy including some of the newer forms that people want to see us go to. We have a lot of different forms of energy. We’re number one in the world. We want to keep it that way. So we’re helping Mexico out. We will be reimbursed in a form sometime in the future.
--
Donald Trump: (44:24)
I think that we’re going to have it in retreat. Will it be today? No. Tomorrow? No, but it will be at a certain point in the not too distant future it will be gone.
--
Donald Trump: (44:36)
We’ll know because people aren’t going to go to the hospital. People aren’t going to get sick. You’re going to know that with that, but we’re going to do very substantial testing. We’re doing more testing right now than any other country in the world by far. And if you’d like to have that question answered, I’ll have the professional answer it. Deborah, perhaps you could come up. We are doing tremendous testing. But you’ll know. You’re going to know before anybody because you’re going to see nobody’s getting sick anymore. It will be gone and it won’t be that much longer.
--
Donald Trump: (48:57)
Want to ask who?
--
Donald Trump: (49:14)
When did they say this would take place? When?
--
Donald Trump: (49:21)
We’ll talk about that. Doctor, would you like to talk about that.
--
Donald Trump: (49:26)
They haven’t seen it. I guess they leaked it to NBC.
--
Donald Trump: (49:31)
But nobody’s seen it and they’re the ones are doing it.
--
Donald Trump: (49:38)
We’ll with find out about it. They don’t know about it. Do you want to say something?
--
Donald Trump: (50:37)
I think we’re going to do both. We’re going to go back to work and we’re going to stay healthy, and staying healthy is also a proportion. If you look at what we’re doing, we’re looking at a date. We hope we’re going to be able to fulfill a certain date, but we’re not doing anything until we know that this country is going to be healthy. We don’t want to go back and start doing it over again, even though it would be in a smaller scale. Yeah. Jeff, go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (51:09)
Yes, which we’ve already done by the way. But we would agree to a reduction cut. They would agree to do something to compensate us in the future.
--
Donald Trump: (51:27)
We didn’t discuss that with Saudi Arabia. We just discussed the numbers and we discussed who’s opposed and who’s not, and pretty much everybody is in favor of it because they’re getting clobbered, they’re all getting clobbered. All of those countries are having problems. If you look at Saudi Arabia, that’s their source of income. Primary source of income by far. So they want to do it. Russia wants to do it. The OPEC nations want to do it. They All want to do it. So we’ll see what happens. There’s a difference between wanting to do it and doing it. Yeah, go ahead. OAN, in the back.
--
Donald Trump: (52:32)
We will not be happy if that takes place. I have not spoken to President Xi of China about Venezuela, about that aspect of Venezuela, but if that took place, we will not be happy. Okay. I will not be happy.
--
Donald Trump: (52:48)
I’m concerned about everything. That’s why I don’t sleep a lot. I get myself concerned about everything, but I would not be happy about that. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (53:18)
I listen to them about everything? I think they’re actually surprised. I have great respect for these people. All of them. [crosstalk 00:53:25] And others that are working with us. I have great respect for this group. In fact, I told Tony Fauci, I said, “Why don’t you move to New York? Run against AOC. You will win easily.” So he decided that he’s not going to do that? I kid, by the way. You know this.
--
Donald Trump: (53:47)
I can only say this. I have tremendous respect for these people and we’ve done very well and when you look at us compared to others, we’re a big nation. When you look at us compared to others, when you see how we’ve taken testing from a broken system that I inherited to having the best tests that anyone’s made anywhere in the world and other countries are calling us wanting to use our technology. I have great respect for these people. I’m never saying bad about this.
--
Donald Trump: (54:19)
I will certainly listen, I will certainly listen. There are two sides. Remember I understand the other side of the argument very well because I look at both sides of an argument. I will listen to them very carefully though. Please go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (54:46)
I think my economic advisers are interested in the third quarter and really the fourth quarter. And I think we have a chance to do record fourth quarter numbers because there’s a tremendous pent up demand. And you see it this week. What reason would there be other than faith in us and in this country, faith in this group and me and our vice president and everybody, governors perhaps, you can add them into it also. What reason would there be in a shortened week, four days instead of five to have the biggest stock market gain in over 50 years? So I think that to me there’s a sign.
--
Donald Trump: (55:24)
Look with all we’ve been down, we’ve never been hit, I don’t know, has this country ever been hit like this? Probably not. 1917 but that was different. It was a different time and frankly Europe took the brunt of it. We didn’t, but it was a terrible time also, but probably never been hit like this. Somebody was saying.
--
Donald Trump: (55:44)
In fact, I was speaking with Governor Cuomo about it because we were in New York City, a place we love New York State with the World Trade Center, and that was approximately 3,000 people. Well we’ve doubled that in this same area. We’ve doubled that, more than double it. Substantially more. And it’s obviously going. We had our highest number yesterday and the day before.
--
Donald Trump: (56:07)
With all of this news, what would lead you to believe that we’re going to have the best stock market week, shortened week, in 50 years. Almost broke the all time record. You know what that is? That’s a pent up demand now. That’s my opinion. The other thing is we’re doing tremendous stimulus plans and despite what you reading, there’s back and forth, but we are getting along with the Democrats. They want to see something happen. We have to help our workers, we have to help our small businesses. We have to help our restaurants. I think deductibility will be great for entertainment, restaurants, all of that.
--
Donald Trump: (56:40)
Look, I think with the stimulus, with the people, with what we’ve got going with all of the things, we’re going to be meeting with the airlines over the weekend. We have a great plan for the airlines. We’ve got to keep the airlines going. It’s never been a great business, but it’s a very vital business for the country. We’re going to be meeting with Boeing, we’re going to be meeting with a lot of companies that are great companies and were great companies a short while ago. We can’t let anything happen to Boeing. It’s got so much potential. You talk about potential, can anything have more potential than that?
--
Donald Trump: (57:15)
So we have a lot of very exciting things taking place. We have tremendous plans, we have tremendous stimulus. And I think we have a chance to do really well. So this quarter isn’t the quarter I’m looking at. Third quarter we start to think about it, and I think fourth quarter is going to be at a level that maybe we haven’t seen before. I think our country, with the stimulus, with all that we’ve been through, we’ve learned a lot. Don’t forget, we’ve about pandemics and epidemics. We’ve learned a tremendous amount, and with all that we’ve learned… As an example, we’re making ventilators. We have thousands of them being delivered in the very near future. We have countries calling us. ” Can we have ventilators?” That would’ve been an unthinkable call. I wouldn’t know what to say. They have people dying, but we needed them for ourselves.
--
Donald Trump: (58:08)
We have plenty before the surge. In New York, they need far fewer hospital rooms or far fewer hospital beds in particular than we thought. And I have to say, Dr. Birx told me that four weeks ago, six weeks. I remember you said “That number is too high. We don’t need that many.” And based on what she said and others, we did what we had to do. We actually gave the maximum. We built Javits, we sent the ship in. We then made the ship COVID because there weren’t a lot of people on the roads. You didn’t have the accidents that we thought, other unrelated accidents, nobody driving. Normally you have a lot of car accidents, you have a lot of motorcycle accidents. You have people going to the hospital. We didn’t have that. We had almost none of it, so a lot of things have happened.
--
Donald Trump: (58:55)
I think we have a chance to be stronger than before. I really do. I think the stimulus is very important to what we’re doing. I think it’s very, very important. Please, go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (59:29)
Well, it’s something that we’ve already suggested. We’re talking to them. Business interruption insurance. I’d like to see these insurance companies. You have people that have paid, when I was in private I had business interruption. When my business was interrupted through a hurricane or whatever it may be, I’d have business where I had it. I didn’t always have it. Sometimes I had it. Sometimes I have a lot of different companies. But if I had it, I’d expect to be paid.
--
Donald Trump: (59:54)
You have people, I speak mostly to the restaurateurs where they have a restaurant they’ve been paying for 25, 30, 35 years. Business interruption, they’ve never needed it. All of a sudden they need it. And I’m very good at reading language. I did very well in these subjects. And I don’t see the word pandemic mentioned. Now some cases it is, it’s an exclusion, but in a lot of cases I don’t see it. I don’t see a reference and they don’t want to pay up. I would like to see the insurance companies pay if they need to pay if it’s fair. And they know what’s fair and I know what’s fair. I can tell you very quickly.
--
Donald Trump: (01:00:31)
But business interruption insurance, that’s getting a lot of money to a lot of people and they’ve been paying for years. Sometimes they just started paying. But you have people that have never asked for business interruption insurance and they’d been paying a lot of money for a lot of years for the privilege of having it and then when they finally need it, the insurance company says we’re not going to give it. We can’t let that happen. Please, go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:01:13)
There are not a lot of issues with this. I got it. There’s not a lot, and it’s a good question. There’s not a lot of issues with testing. Certain sections of the… We go to Iowa, we go to Nebraska, we go… And interestingly Idaho is very interesting because they had a few breakouts, small breakouts, but they are very, very capable states, and they’re big distances. A lot of land, a lot of opening.
--
Donald Trump: (01:01:38)
You don’t need testing there. Where you have a state with a small number of cases, some states with almost none. West Virginia hung in for a long time, as with none for a long time. So when you have that, you don’t need testing. You don’t have to test every person in the state of Iowa as an example. You don’t have to test every single person to say, “Let’s open up and let’s get the tractors moving and let’s get the corn” and let’s open up all of the different things they do in that great state. You don’t need that.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:11)
With that being said, if there’s a little hot corner someplace, we’ll be testing, but I think Deborah speaks to this very well. Same thing in New York. That’s what we talked to Governor Cuomo about this morning. We have the Abbott test, which is very quick and very easy. It goes very fast. Then we have a lesser test that we talked about where we can talk about a larger area. So we’re going to do testing, but you don’t need to test 325 to 350 million people because, number one, it’s unnecessary. Vast numbers, vast areas of our country don’t need this. I think you agree with me on that. You just don’t need it.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:53)
Now we have certain hotspots, so Louisiana’s a hotspot, New York’s a hotspot, Detroit’s a hotspot. And then you have certain areas in certain hotspots that you have to even go more so. And we’re doing all of that. Remember this, we’ve done more testing than any country in the world and we have the best test and we developed this over a very short period of time. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:03:34)
Well we do have a plan and one of the things I’m most proud about is what I’ve been able to do for the African American community. The lowest job numbers in the history of our country.
--
Donald Trump: (01:03:46)
Just before the virus came. Well, I’m just saying, because this has been here for three weeks. So just before, African American community had the lowest unemployment, the best employment numbers, more African American people and communities have been thriving. If you look at our opportunity zones and what we did, Tim Scott, who is a fantastic Senator, came to me, opportunity zones. More jobs for African Americans than ever before. Better healthcare than they’ve ever had before. All of these things. The surgeon general spoke to it and he spoke to it, I thought really brilliantly. I found it very interesting what he said. And I’d love you to come up and answer the second part of her question because I think you would do a much better job than I would please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:06:49)
Would you like to add anything to it because you expressed it very beautifully before.
--
Donald Trump: (01:07:12)
And I can tell you Jerome has done a fantastic job. Our surgeon general, I just hope nobody steals him and he goes to one of these big companies for a fortune. Don’t leave us. Don’t leave us Jerome.
--
Donald Trump: (01:07:24)
He’s doing a great… You are happy and you’re doing a great job. And everybody tells me that too, so we appreciate it. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:07:45)
[crosstalk 01:07:45] problems and a lot of other things. Is it something we’re going to look at it, certainly, and we know they’ve done that. And it’s highly, it’s very new, new technology. It’s very interesting. But a lot of people worry about it in terms of a person’s freedom. We’re going to take a look at that, a very strong look at it. We’ll let you know pretty soon.
--
Donald Trump: (01:08:03)
Brand new. Yes?
--
Donald Trump: (01:08:03)
… had a very strong look at it. We’ll let you know pretty soon. Brand-new. Yes, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:08:14)
Well, we’re going to talk about the WHO next week, in great detail. I didn’t want to do it today, Good Friday. I didn’t want to do it before Easter. I also didn’t want to do it before we have all the facts. But over the years, many years, we’ve been paying them from 300 to 500 and even more million dollars a year. China’s been paying them less than 40 over the years. So we’re paying them more than 10 times more than China. And they are very, very China-centric, as I said during the weeks, China-centric. China always seems to get the better of the argument and I don’t like that. I really don’t like that. I don’t think that’s appropriate. I don’t think it’s fair to the American people. I’d tell that to President Xi. I’d tell that to Dr. Tedros. I spoke to him one time. I think he’s a very nice man. I liked him, but we’re going to be talking about that next week, in great detail. We’re looking at it very, very closely.
--
Donald Trump: (01:09:18)
We want to make sure money is properly spent. But again, why is the United States paying $500 million a year? That’s a lot. That’s a lot. And why is China paying last year, this year, $42 million? But generally under 40, so it’s in the 30s. So we’re at 500, 452, 400, 401, different amounts, different years, and they’re at 40, 38, 36, 35, 32, 31.
--
Donald Trump: (01:09:54)
No, no. But you have to ask yourself that question and then the answer always turns out to be in China’s favor. Well, I have the same thing with the World Trade. Isn’t that interesting? World Trade. So we have World Health and we have World Trade, so we have the World Trade Organization. And until I came along we were losing cases, so many cases, it was ridiculous. We were always losing these cases. I mean, almost every case. And now we’re winning cases. We just won $7 billion because they know I’m not going to put up with it.
--
Donald Trump: (01:10:25)
China has been unbelievably taken advantage of us and other countries, since they’re considered a developing nation. I said, well then make us a developing nation too. They get big advantages because they’re a developing nation. India, a developing nation. The United States is the big developed nation. Well, we have plenty of development to do. Okay? And now we’re winning cases because they know that if we’re not treated fairly, I’m going to pull out. Now, you never heard this before because nobody ever talked about the World Trade Organization, but the World Trade Organization has treated us very unfairly. But they know I’m not going to put up with it because all of these countries are taking advantage of the United States.
--
Donald Trump: (01:11:09)
Now, in the courts, and the court system, we’re not approving new judges, over the last year and a half. We’re not going to approve them. And Bob Lighthizer is working very hard on that. But we had always a minority position, meaning numbers of judges. So we’d have a minority number of judges. I said, how do you win with a minority number of judges? But all of a sudden we’re winning and the reason we’re winning is they know if they don’t treat us properly… And we won $7 billion just this very recently, and the money is pouring in. And we won other cases too. We want a lot of cases.
--
Donald Trump: (01:11:44)
But you know from covering it, I know you know, that the United States was taken advantage of by the World Trade Organization. And by the way, speaking of China, if you look at the history of China, it was only since they went into the World Trade Organization that they became a rocket ship with their economy. They were flatlined for years and years, frankly for many, many decades. And it was only when they came into the World Trade Organization that they became a rocket ship because they took advantage of all those. I’m not even blaming them. I’m saying, how stupid were the people that stood here and allowed it to happen? But we don’t allow that to happen. And if they don’t treat us fairly, we’ll leave. But now we’re starting to win cases.
--
Donald Trump: (01:12:29)
How about somebody new for a change? Come on. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:12:56)
Well, I have a lot of confidence in Ron DeSantis, a lot of faith in Ron DeSantis to make the right decision. He’s doing a great job as governor. Ron DeSantis, I had read where he’s thinking about opening up the schools earlier than the date, the end of the month. I’d have to look at the numbers, but again, I like to allow governors to make decisions without overruling them, because from a constitutional standpoint, that’s the way it should be done. If I disagreed, I would overrule a governor, and I have that right to do it. But I’d rather have them, you can call it Federalists, you can call it the constitution, but I call it the constitution. I would rather have them make their decisions. But he’s made a lot of good decisions and he hasn’t said he’s going to, but he’s thinking about it, so I’ll take a look at it.
--
Donald Trump: (01:13:55)
I think the answer is obvious, but if you want, either, would you want to just talk about that, maybe? Tony? I think I know the answer to that.
--
Donald Trump: (01:15:17)
Depending on the outbreak, yeah. And that’s happened as you know, with a couple of countries. You know what I’m doing? I’m watching the other countries, in many cases, they’re ahead of us from the standpoint that it attacked them before us. It hit them first. And I’m watching what’s happening with respect to certain other countries. Some of them obvious, some of them less obvious and what they’re doing and the success of having. And that’s going to play a large part of the role.
--
Donald Trump: (01:15:44)
We’re also setting up a council of very, very great doctors and business people. We’re going to be announcing it on Tuesday. Some great people.
--
Donald Trump: (01:15:59)
This is beyond economic. This is really, I call it the Opening our Country Taskforce, or Opening our Country Council, so we don’t get it confused with Mike’s task force, which has done so great. And we’re going to have the great business leaders, great doctors. We’re going to have a great group of people. We’ll probably do it by teleconference because we don’t really want them traveling in for their own purposes. I don’t think it would look good also, but we don’t want them traveling in, so we’ll do teleconference. We did one the other day with the banks and it was very successful, the teleconference itself. And we’ll be announcing names on Tuesday, who’s on that, and that’ll play a role. But ultimately, I have to make that decision and then I’ll have to make a decision, do we close a little area that’s a hotspot?
--
Donald Trump: (01:16:43)
I do say this, Jim, I want to get it open as soon as possible. This country was meant to be open and vibrant and great. Not where people are staying in-
--
Donald Trump: (01:16:55)
I would love to open it. I’m not determined to anything. The facts are going to determine what I do, but we do want to get the country opened. It’s so important. So I have a task force, I’ll have a council. It’s going to be announced on a Tuesday with the names that you have a lot of respect for, a lot of great names, different businesses, different people. Top-
--
Donald Trump: (01:17:18)
Bipartisan. I didn’t even ask. I mean honestly, I think it’s bipartisan. The one thing I didn’t ask, are you Republican or a Democrat? Hard to believe, but I didn’t ask. So it would be, and I want their views on what they think. Also very important, different parts of the country. Because you go to the Midwest, it’s different than perhaps the East Coast or the West Coast. Now, the West Coast, those numbers are really pretty amazing on the West Coast. Very interesting. So we’re going to be announcing that in a very short while, probably Tuesday. Go ahead, you.
--
Donald Trump: (01:18:04)
Well, what we’re doing, we have a tremendous force out there, Naval force, and we’re blocking the shipment of drugs. So maybe what they’re doing is stopping ships that they want to look. We’re not blocking. What we’re doing is we’re making sure… We don’t want drugs in our country, and especially with the over 160 miles of wall, it’s getting very hard to get through the border. They used to drive right through the border like they owned it, and in a certain way, they did. They could drive, right? They had human trafficking. All of a sudden they have a powerful wall up and they’re not driving through that wall. That wall is tough and it’s also loaded up with equipment, cameras and sensors and everything you can think of. On top of that, we have drones flying back and forth over it, so it’s a very powerful barrier between Mexico and the United States.
--
Donald Trump: (01:18:55)
A lot of people though, what they’re doing now is they’re trying to come in through the waterways, whether it’s the Gulf or the ocean itself. And what we’re doing is we’re being very tough and we’re being tough because of drugs and also human trafficking. And remember, the human trafficking is mostly females. It’s mostly females. It’s horrible and what we’re seeing is horrible. We have a human trafficking problem worldwide, the likes of which, you think of it as an ancient thing. It’s not ancient. It’s bigger now than it’s ever been before, over the last 10 years, because of the internet. The internet made human trafficking to the extent that it is now, which is massive. The internet made it so big. We have a big Naval force that’s stopping, so maybe when you mentioned that, maybe their ships are getting caught. But we are stopping a lot of ships and we’re finding a lot of drugs. Yeah, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:19:57)
I meant you, but that’s okay. Go ahead, we’ll do this.
--
Donald Trump: (01:19:59)
Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:20:07)
Are you talking about the new-
--
Donald Trump: (01:20:10)
Yeah, 250.
--
Donald Trump: (01:20:17)
I’d rather have that be in phase four. I don’t deny it. I think it’s fine, but I think it should be in phase four and I think we should have infrastructure. And I think we should have a payroll tax moratorium because that’s something that over a period of time the workers get sort of semi-immediately. It’s over that period of time. It starts immediately, but it’s over a period of time. I mean, there are a lot of people, I’m one of them, that would have liked to have seen the payroll tax cut as a permanent cut. But we should do the double-edged, meaning business-employee payroll tax cut. So we’re talking about that and I’m certainly okay with helping the States and helping the hospitals. I just think, because look, the hospitals need help. You see what they’ve gone through and the States need help. Some states in particular need help. They need big help.
--
Donald Trump: (01:21:08)
I’m willing to look at that very strongly, but I like looking at it in phase four. The 251 is actually, the plan is working out well, the banks are getting started with the distribution. They’ve taken thousands and thousands of applications. The numbers aren’t even believable, the number of applications. They’re swamped, with Bank of America and Wells Fargo and I guess Citi Bank is just now kicking in. And also what nobody’s talking about, the commercial banks, the community banks, everyone’s talking commercial banks. The community banks are doing tremendous volumes and they’re probably doing them faster, from what I understand. I hear the community banks frankly are the easiest ones in terms of getting the money out. So the money is getting out. The applications are far beyond what we ever anticipated and that’s why we’re going… Because this is money that goes essentially, to the workers. We want the businesses to hold onto their workers because once they lose the workers, they’re never opening again. It’s not going to happen. Okay. In the back.
--
Donald Trump: (01:22:26)
Well, there’s no real cost because we’re agreeing to produce a little bit less. So number one, it’s staying in the ground, you have it, you have it for another day. It’s actually cheaper than storing it where you take it out and you deliver it to a massive well, like the strategic reserves, our national strategic reserves, where it has to be brought there. That’s an expensive process in itself. But oil is getting to a point where, I mean, there are some areas, some people would say the water is more valuable than the oil. You never thought you’re going to see that. You never thought, having covered, I know you cover it, you never thought you’d be seeing oil at $20 a barrel, but how about $ 10 a barrel? That, you’d never thought you’d see. So we are looking at it very strongly. There is no real cost.
--
Donald Trump: (01:23:06)
I want to help Mexico out. We have a great relationship with Mexico, great relationship with the president. I really like him a lot. He’s been terrific to us in the border because he stopped. You don’t see the caravans coming up anymore. You don’t see all the problems. When I took office, it was unbelievable what was going on. And they have been helping us a lot and we’ve been helping them a lot. They make product for us, they sell it to us and it’s fine. It’s a good relationship. Sometimes it’s a great relationship.
--
Donald Trump: (01:23:38)
He could not have done any more than that. And I think there was political reasons for that for him, that other nations don’t have. They don’t have that. The nations that we’re talking about, the 22 other nations that we’re talking about, they just don’t have that problem. So it doesn’t cost us anything and yet, it’s very valuable. We will be reimbursed in the future, maybe in the near future, maybe in the more distant future, but we’ll be reimbursed by Mexico in a certain way and it’ll be fine. But we get Mexico over the hump.
--
Donald Trump: (01:24:10)
Now, with all of that being said, that doesn’t mean the deal is going to happen anyway because they still have a lot of different stakes. But this was one of the stumbling blocks. Okay, go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:24:37)
Well, look, the way I view it is this. China has taken advantage of the United States for 30 years. I mentioned the World Trade Organization. China has taken advantage of us through that and using rules that are unfair to the United States and they should have never been allowed. This should’ve never been allowed to happen. When China joined and was allowed to join under those circumstances, the World Trade Organization, that was a very bad day for the United States because they had rules and regulations that were far different and far easier than our rules and regulations. Plus, they took advantage of them down to the last, and you know China and you study China, and you know what I mean. They took advantage of them like very few people would even think to take advantage of them.
--
Donald Trump: (01:25:28)
Again, they are considered a developing nation. We are not considered a developing nation. They’re given advantages. Okay. For many years, China has ripped off the United States, and then I came along. And right now as you know, China is paying 25% and we’ve taken in billions and billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China. And I know a lot of the people kept saying, “Oh no, we’re paying.” Well, we’re not paying. Countries are different, not every country is China. But China would devalue their currency and then also pour out money. And they essentially were paying most of those tariffs, not us. And as you know, we’ve taken in tens of billions of dollars. They targeted our farmers, but we took in so much money that I was able to give back, one year it was 12 billion, one year it was 16 billion. I was able to give back our farmers the money that they were targeted, hurt,
--
Donald Trump: (01:26:21)
China bought $12 billion and bought $16 billion, one year 12 one year 16. I was able to give them back the 12 and then give them back the 16, the farmers and they weren’t targeted and they’re all in business. Now, we’re doing it because they got targeted in a different way. Now, I’m going to be very interested to see. So we signed a deal with China and under that deal, they’re supposed to buy substantially in excess of $200 billion from us. That’s not only foreign product, it’s manufacturing product, it’s lots of different things. They’re going to buy a lot. I just want to see if they live up to that deal. I know President Xi. I would say he would live up to the deal. But remember this, I never took off the tariff. It’s still 25%, 25% of $250 billion. So for the first time and you saw also…
--
Donald Trump: (01:27:10)
Now again, I’m going before the virus, because that’s sort of like, “Let’s start all over again.” I can’t tell you that yet because that chapter hasn’t been written yet. But go up a few weeks ago, the deficit with the United States and China was coming way down. Nobody’s ever seen that before. But the deficit has come way down. So now, we start a new chapter. And I can only tell you if a smart person is standing where I’m standing, we’re going to do very well with China. I have to also say this, I think our relationship and having the relationship I have with China is a good thing. But for the first time, we’re benefiting instead of being the sucker that got taken advantage, for years. I said to China, “How did this ever happen?” I got to know them very well. I said to them, representatives of China, at the top level… You know who I’m talking about. I say, “How did this ever happen?” They looked at me and they said, “But nobody ever called us.”
--
Donald Trump: (01:28:19)
We didn’t have a deal. It’s not like we had a bad deal. We had worse, we didn’t have any deal at all. So they just took advantage. Think of it, $500 billion a year deficit. $500 million is a lot of money, right? Everyone thinks I’ve made a mistake when I say $500 trillion. No, you mean $500 million. No. I said $500 billion a year deficit with China, for a long time. But it 200, it was 300, it was 400, it was 500, $556 billion, $507. $500 billion plus a year deficit with China. Now, I’m charging them tariffs. It’s very interesting, a lot of people that don’t want to do that, they all agreed. Because China has taken advantage of this country like nobody has ever taken. We have built China with the money we gave them. Now, I give them a lot of credit. I give them a lot of credit. They did it, but you know what? We made it a hell of a lot easier. We gave them a fortune.
--
Donald Trump: (01:29:24)
Go ahead. How about you, in the back? Yes.
--
Donald Trump: (01:29:40)
Sure, go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:29:40)
A little louder, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:29:48)
Have I been tested?
--
Donald Trump: (01:29:50)
Not that I know of. I’ve had some tests.
--
Donald Trump: (01:29:54)
No. They tell me no. I’ll accept that.
--
Donald Trump: (01:29:59)
That’ll come out. They’ve just developed those tests. It’s sort of new.
--
Donald Trump: (01:30:27)
Yeah. Well, the aid hasn’t been given yet, but they will be asking in my opinion. They haven’t even asked yet. Boeing has not asked for aid yet, but I think they probably will. Now, at the same time, they do have to run a company. This isn’t a great time to sell airplanes, let’s not kid ourselves. If you’re a business person, Boeing makes airplanes. They had a big problem with one, but they make the greatest airplanes. They make the best airplanes in the world. They had the problem with one, they got it too complex. It becomes so complex, you have to be number one in your class at MIT to be able to fly it. It’s a mistake. Every two years they want to make it more and more. I mean, they had great success with the 737, the Boeing 737. Then all of a sudden they do the Max and they say, “Let’s make it more complicated. Let’s put on different engines. Let’s do this. Let’s do that.” It was not exactly a good decision. Bad decision, very horrible decision.
--
Donald Trump: (01:31:23)
Number one, human lives and number two horrible what’s happened to the company. Here’s a company, from a business standpoint, it was probably the greatest company in the world, in my opinion. I think it amounts to 1% of GDP. Some people say it’s a half, I think it’s 1. But here’s one of the greatest companies anywhere in the world, maybe the greatest and boom. Now, on top of what happened there with the two planes, and they say they have that fixed, that’s good. They say they have it fixed, indisputably. In fact, somebody said, they gave me something. I said, “You should say it that way.” They said, “Sir, this is now the safest airplane in the air.” I said, “That’s what you should say. That’s a very good statement. It’s the safest airplane in the air. That’s a very good statement. You should use it.” I said, “By the way, are you changing the name? But whether you do or not, you should use that.” But he said that. A Boeing person said to me, “It’s the safest airplane in the air.” that’s a great thing.
--
Donald Trump: (01:32:23)
But we know they’re going to need help. Now, does that mean they’re going to need help and they should keep people that they absolutely don’t need? That business is a very cyclical business, like many businesses, frankly. That determination hasn’t been made. They have not spoken to us yet. I think they will be. Maybe they won’t need help. That’ll be great. Look, Boeing made so much money. Who would have thought, they had all of those planes that are parked all over the place, in many cases, I guess, payments not made. But who would’ve thought they could do that and they’re still a solvent company? I mean, what a tragic thing happened in numerous ways, but also economically. So when they see us, making sure that Boeing is strong again is very, very powerful and very important and we’ll do whatever is necessary to do. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:33:18)
Should we keep this going, everybody?
--
Donald Trump: (01:33:21)
Jim wants to leave. No, I’m only kidding. Keep it going for a while, yes? I mean, we have time, if you want. You’re not going to criticize me, that the conference was too long? If I leave short, yesterday I left short, “It was too short.” If I stay too long they say it was too long. Some day we’re going to get it just right. Okay. Should we continue? Should we continue? Yes?
--
Donald Trump: (01:33:45)
Okay. At least for your question.
--
Donald Trump: (01:33:47)
It’s not a bad point.
--
Donald Trump: (01:33:51)
I have not. No. I have a call just to wish him well, to his group. No, I don’t want to be calling him now. I want him to get better. He’s a great guy. He’s become a friend of mine, real friend of mine. He has a great feeling for our country. Obviously, for his country, he loves it. He’s a tremendous guy.
--
Donald Trump: (01:34:13)
I think he’s probably right now… He was very high… I think he might be 100% popularity right now. When they talk about approval polls, right? You ever hear that term? I’m sure you’ve never heard that. I hear it all the time. His approval rating must be about 300%. but he’s a great guy. He was a great guy before and I think people see what he’s been through. What he’s been through is incredible. And they say, a big turn, so let’s see what happens. Let’s hope.
--
Donald Trump: (01:34:48)
Something like? Excuse me.
--
Donald Trump: (01:34:54)
Yeah. I see a lot of different things. We’re going to be very careful for who comes into the country. Look, my opposition party wants to have open borders. This is a case where I’m very glad that my position is, I don’t want to open borders. I want very strong borders. That includes not only on this Southern border, our Southern border with Mexico, and you could also say our Northern border with Canada, but we want to have strong borders. And I think this is maybe one of the learning points. We learned something about borders. We need borders. The country needs borders to be a great country and I think this is a great point. Go ahead. You have something else?
--
Donald Trump: (01:35:50)
You mean once they get better?
--
Donald Trump: (01:35:53)
Okay. So they have the disease and they’re better and they have the immunity now. Supposedly, according to what I’m hearing, it could be for a long period, could be for a lifetime, it could also be for a year or two, I’m hearing Tony. Nobody’s told me yet, if it’s for a year, if it’s for two years or if it’s for a lifetime. Like chickenpox, they say if you have chickenpox, you have immunity, they say for a lifetime. I hope that’s true. But nobody’s actually told me with certainty, maybe because they don’t know yet.
--
Donald Trump: (01:36:23)
You don’t know yet. Because it’s new. This came upon us. Nobody knew. They do know you have it for a period of time and it’s strong for a period of time. They don’t know. That’s hence the antibodies that we’re making.
--
Donald Trump: (01:36:37)
I saw somebody who was really sick and he got better, a young person, relatively young person, 35 and physically fit and he got better. He made it barely, but he made it. His first thing that he did when he was better is, “I want to give whatever I can give to help other people because nobody should go through.” It’s a tough thing. So we don’t know yet how long… If you’d like to add anything to that, but we don’t know yet. Is it a year? It will be a year, but is it more than a year? And only time is going to tell. Okay, thank you.
--
Donald Trump: (01:37:11)
Go ahead. We’ll try one more.
--
Donald Trump: (01:37:19)
Yeah. I think so. I think we’re going to put some governors. I’ve gained great respect for governors, both Republican and Democrat. I’ve actually become friends with some of the Democrat governors that I wouldn’t have really had the privilege of getting to know. And Governor Murphy of New Jersey is a very liberal guy. I’m not. But we’ve had a great relationship. John Bell, as you know, I call him John Bell, but John Bell Edwards, people call him John Bell, sort of a cool name, from Louisiana. I have a very good relationship with him.
--
Donald Trump: (01:37:54)
Gavin Newsom, honestly, I think… Hey, we’re fighting right now. I want automobiles to be made cheaper and safer and stronger. But you save three, $4,000 per… and environmentally equal, or better maybe. And we’re fighting on that. We’re fighting a lot of different things. We fight on the border. He wants open borders. I want people to come into our country illegally. But I’ve gotten very friendly with Gavin Newsome. He’s done a very good job here.
--
Donald Trump: (01:38:28)
I think I’ve gotten very friendly, I mean, he’s been sort of a friend of mine for a long time, don’t get to see him much, but Governor Cuomo of New York. We talk all the time. I told you I spoke to him literally, the last call just before walking in here. I’ve really developed a lot of good friendships with the governors. And including the governors, I think Mike DeWine, Republican, but I think he’s done a great job in Ohio. So yeah, I want to put on both parties. I want to have some governors. Am I going to have all of the governors? But I’d like to put some representative governors on the council. Yes, I would like to do that.
--
Donald Trump: (01:39:06)
I have, I’ve asked a couple of them. They’ve all said yes. So far, everyone said yes. I think everybody would like to be on that council. That’s a very important council. Go ahead in the back, you haven’t gone yet.
--
Donald Trump: (01:39:28)
You’re going to have to say it louder. To those what?
--
Donald Trump: (01:39:37)
Oh, the pastors. I didn’t understand your word. You have a very nice voice but it’s a little bit low and you’re far back. I’ve had talks with the pastors and most of the pastures agree. This is a very complex subject. Let’s face it, for the obvious reasons I don’t have to go into it. Most of the pastors agree that they are better off doing what they’re doing, which is distancing. They feel that, let’s get this over with and they want to get back to church so badly. I mean, can you imagine we have Easter Sunday and I’m going to be watching Pastor Robert Jeffress, who’s been a great guy. Did I tell you? He’s been a great guy and I’m going to be watching on a laptop.
--
Donald Trump: (01:40:20)
Now, a laptop is not the same as being in his church or being in another church. It’s not and no matter what you say, you don’t get to say, “Oh, isn’t wonderful.” But I’ve done this for three weeks and they’ve had tremendous… I let people know who it is. They’ve had the biggest audiences they’ve ever had. They have millions of people now watching and people are really liking what they’re hearing. I’m going to be with, on Easter, Pastor… I don’t even know if he knows it yet, but he will soon. I think he will in about two minutes. Pastor Robert Jeffress and he’s a terrific guy, a terrific man. I’ve gotten to know him very well. He’s a man of great compassion. He loves our country and I’m going to be with him on Easter, meaning, I’m going to be with him watching on a laptop. Doesn’t sound good, but it’s one of those things.
--
Donald Trump: (01:41:08)
It can not be church, and I’m not going to get into it. It cannot be church. Most pastors and most people of faith, people that we’ll listen to and respect and admire. Franklin Graham is a person I have great respect for and who’s done an incredible job in New York on Central Park where they put up Samaritan’s Purse. He’s done an incredible job. The son of the late great Billy Graham. His family is incredible. He’s incredible. Franklin Graham, the job he’s doing, I mean, he loves to do it. He has such a passion and that’s why he’s so good at it. He does it with incredible love. And he will tell you, we’re all saying, we’ve got to get our country cured. I know there are some pastors and ministers and others that want to get together and I have great respect for them. Two of them I know, but I would say for…
--
Donald Trump: (01:42:03)
And I have great respect for him. Two of them I know, but I would say first heal … I’m a Christian, heal our country. Let’s get healed before we do this and there’s time to do that. We’ll do it for hopefully the rest of our lives. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:42:23)
Yeah. Yeah.
--
Donald Trump: (01:42:33)
So the Mercy and the Comfort were sent when projections were much higher. And I say, Tony backed it up. Debra’s made the statement, they said, “You’re not going to need these many rooms.” But we wanted to be prepared. I mean, we had the ship, they did an incredible job with … The Comfort was supposed to be in maintenance for a period of four weeks and they had it done in three and a half, four days and it came up. And so we had it there. If there was a disaster from the standpoint of you needed all of the … I tell you, the Javits Center, Andrew will tell you we were ready to go. It’s incredible the job they did, but they’re using less beds. This is a good thing, not a bad thing. They’re using less beds.
--
Donald Trump: (01:43:20)
Now, Javits has been pretty busy over the last couple of days and the death numbers are horrific, but you go back now and you’re finding they’re going to start to come down very substantially just based on the fact that the bed usage, the number of beds are much, much less, much, much less. So the Mercy and the Comfort were there in case they needed them. Los Angeles, where you have the one, and New York where you have the other, they just don’t … Fortunately, we haven’t hit numbers where they would have needed, they would have been used. There are always going to be sort of overflow because they’re on the edges, they’re not as convenient as certain places, but the people were ready, willing, and able. They were ready to go. They were going to do a great job. But fortunately we don’t need, just like we didn’t need as many ventilators, when they were asking in New York for 40,000 ventilators. I had experts, these people, I listened to them, they said, “You’ll never need that many.” And they were right.
--
Donald Trump: (01:44:21)
New York now has … And I dealt really well with Mayor de Blasio. We got him a lot of ventilators. We got Andrew a lot of ventilators, but we never felt you needed the numbers that you were talking about and we were right on that. Now, with all of that being said, we have a lot of ventilators ready to go. We have almost 10,000 in the stockpile. That 10,000 can move rapidly. We can be within 24 hours almost anywhere, and hopefully we’re not going to have to be, but it’s just … It’s really … This has been a great military operation. It hasn’t all been military, because we’re dealing with great companies. We’re have companies that are making masks and we’re all set up in the masks too.
--
Donald Trump: (01:45:01)
I just told you, we have an order coming in soon. 500 million masks, 500 million. We have companies, you know the story with GM or 3M, also GM, but 3M is doing a great job. I spoke to the CEO the other day. We settled it out. We had a dispute with them and it’s now all settled and I think they’re trying to show the country something. Maybe me, but the country something. So we’ve done … And not me. I’m not talking about me. This country, our country, the people that are doing it, Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA, these people sitting right here, people that we have in the back that are watching every word that we’re saying, they’ve done a fantastic job. They really have done a fantastic job. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:46:01)
Well what do we have?
--
Donald Trump: (01:46:03)
Hold on. What do we have? 350 million people? You want to do 300-
--
Donald Trump: (01:46:26)
You’re asking that because of what happened? It’s a fair question too, what happened in Denver. Because in Denver I’ve never seen, I said, “What’s going on?” We’re looking at this graph where everything’s looking beautiful and it’s coming down and then you’ve got this one spike. I said, “What happened to Denver?” And many people very quickly, and by the way, they were on it like so fast. You wouldn’t believe it. They knew every aspect. They have people going, not only testing, who did you see? Where were you? How many people did you meet? Were you out to dinner in somebody else’s home? Where were you? Where did this number of people come from? How did … They are totally on it now this just happened. I just saw it this morning. I’m looking at everything smooth going down, topping out. Then you have this one spike in Denver. It’s like, “Where did this come from?”
--
Donald Trump: (01:47:18)
So we’ll be looking at that and we don’t want cases like that happening. This was … But this is the kind of thing can happen. This is very complex. It’s a very brilliant enemy. It’s a brilliant enemy. They develop drugs like the antibiotics, you see it. Antibiotics used to solve every problem. Now, one of the biggest problems the world has is the germ has gotten so brilliant that the antibiotic can’t keep up with it. And they’re constantly trying to come up with a new … People go to a hospital and they catch … They go for a heart operation, that’s no problem. But they end up dying from problems. You know the problems I’m talking about. There’s a whole genius to it. We’re fighting … Not only is it hidden, but it’s very smart. Okay? It’s invisible and it’s hidden. But it’s very smart. And you see that in a case like a Denver. But I think we’re doing well and they’re on Denver like you wouldn’t believe. I came in this morning, it was a flurry. I said, “What’s going on?” They said, “Denver.” I said, “What happened in Denver?” Because Denver was doing pretty well and they’ve got that under control. But yeah, that would be a case where you do some very big testing. Peter?
--
Donald Trump: (01:48:47)
Number one, I love them. Number two, we’re working really hard. It wasn’t their fault what happened. Sometimes they don’t do a good job and they lose their job. That’s one thing. This is a case where we take the strongest economy in the history of the world, which is what we had. More people working in the United States, Peter, than ever before. Almost, I mean, look at the numbers. 160 million people, almost just short of 160. Excuse me. So we have the greatest economy we’ve ever had, and by the way, black unemployment, Hispanic unemployment, Asian unemployment, the best numbers we’ve ever had in virtually every way. And then you get hit like this and it’s dramatic. People that had great jobs that went out to dinner and they didn’t have any problems, they take their family, they were making good salaries. All of a sudden, you use the term cold turkey, it’s cold turkey. They go from that to having no money and waiting for their checks, which are being processed very rapidly, but they still … They have to go out and look for money. It’s a terrible thing. All I say is we love them, we’re working so hard, and they’re going to be back, and I hope they’re going to be back even stronger than before.
--
Donald Trump: (01:50:13)
Yeah, no, it’s really … The states can do things if they want. I can override it if I want, but the national stay at home, just so you understand, 95% of the country is stay at home. Like as an example, I was speaking with the great governor of Texas, Greg Abbott the other day. He has a stay at home. A lot of people didn’t even know it, but he had to stay at home. Some people reported Texas wasn’t. He had a very strong, actually a very strong state at home, 95 to 96%. South Carolina, as you know, has it, which at one point, we could go, they didn’t have South Carolina, another great governor, McMaster. No, 95% of the country is covered. Now, the states that aren’t, and again, constitutionally from a Federalist standpoint, if I thought there was a problem, if I saw a state with a problem, I would absolutely demand it. But they’re doing great. And the states that aren’t, are states that have not had a big problem.
--
Donald Trump: (01:51:19)
I have great authority if I want to use it, I would rather have the states use it. I would rather … And this is so shocking for me, a lot of people are saying, “Wow, he’s really very [inaudible 01:51:27].” A lot of people are shocked. They think I’d do it. I have absolute authority to use it, but so far our relationship with governors and the job they’re doing, I haven’t had to do it. Would I do it? If I saw a state that was out of control and they didn’t have the stay at home policy, I would do it in a heartbeat. Jeff?
--
Donald Trump: (01:51:51)
It’s a very big decision.
--
Donald Trump: (01:51:52)
I don’t know that I’ve had a bigger decision than that, when you think, right, I mean, think of that decision. Somebody said it’s totally up to the president, I saw it this morning, it’s totally up, and it is. I don’t know that I’ve had a bigger decision, but I’m going to surround myself with the greatest minds. Not only the greatest minds but the greatest minds in numerous different businesses, including the business of politics and reason, and we’re going to make a decision and hopefully it’s going to be the right decision. I will say this, I want to get it open as soon as we can. We have to get our country open, Jeff.
--
Donald Trump: (01:52:28)
The metrics right here. That’s my metrics. That’s all I can do. I can listen to 35 people. At the end, I’ve got to make a decision and I didn’t think of it until yesterday. I said, “This is a big decision.” But I want to be guided. I’m going to be guided by them. I’m going to be guided by our vice president. I’m going to make a decision based on a lot of different opinions. Some will maybe disagree, and some I’d love to see it where they don’t disagree. Will there be risks? It’s always going to be a risk that something can flare up. There’s always going to … Look, look at what’s happening where countries are trying to get open and there’s a flare up and they’ll go, but I’d like the flare up to be very localized so that we can control it from a local standpoint without having to close. There’s always a risk.
--
Donald Trump: (01:53:17)
This is genius that we’re fighting, we’re fighting this hidden enemy, which is genius. Okay? It’s genius. The way it’s attacked so many countries at so many different angles. I mean, you take a look at what’s going on and the greatest doctors in the world, I think they’re close, by the way, but they haven’t figured it out yet. Look what it’s done to some people. I mean, some people it’s grabbed and it’s a horrible way to go. You want to know the truth. It’s a horrible … And then other people that hardly has an impact. We talked about it, it’s sniffles, it’s less. They don’t even know they had anything. And some people … I looked at New York this morning and I look at what’s happening in the amount of people that are dying. And dying, violently dying. It’s a very tough adversary, but we’re going to win and we’re going to win it very decisively. I’m going to have to make a decision, and I only hope to God that it’s the right decision. But I would say without question, it’s the biggest decision I’ve ever had to make.
--
Donald Trump: (01:54:52)
Want to answer that?
--
Donald Trump: (02:00:16)
I just want to say that you’ve talked about couldn’t it lead to death, meaning you open up could lead to death and you’re right, but you know what? Staying at home leads to death also. And it’s very traumatic for this country, but staying at home, if you look at numbers, that leads to a different kind of death perhaps, but it leads to death also. So it’s a very big decision. As I say, it’s the biggest decision I’ll ever make. All right. We’ll do a couple of more and we’ll go. Thank you.
--
Donald Trump: (02:00:53)
Yes.
--
Donald Trump: (02:01:10)
The other side seems to keep using that, and I have used it. I’ve enacted it, and I’ve used it, some people thought viciously, just ask a couple of companies if you want, you can just look up the names. And I’m surprised that he would’ve said that. We actually have great tests. We have others under development. You don’t need full testing, as the doctors have been talking about ad nauseum. So I would be surprised that he would’ve said that meaning it that way. If he did, I’d have a much different type answer. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (02:01:44)
We talked about testing. Yeah, we did talk about testing and one of the things I did was I put the two doctors in charge of that call. I said, “You know what Andrew? I have two very talented people standing here. We’re getting ready to go on. Let me put them and let me have them talk to you.” And they talked to him really at length and I think by the time they finished he understood what he was, what we were saying. He understood it very clearly.
--
Donald Trump: (02:02:31)
I understand the question very well. Nobody has done to China or treated China as strongly as I have, used the word strongly. As you know, you’ve reported on it. Billions and billions of is flowing into our treasury because of what I’ve done with China. I think it’s a very sad thing that happened, and I think if people knew, including the World Health Organization, and I do believe they knew, but they didn’t want to tell the world, and we’re going to get to the bottom of it, and we’ll have reports on all of this and we are … We’re not happy about it, but I wanted to leave the world health war later and I can tell you that we’re constantly in touch with China. We’re talking to China, and we’ve expressed how we felt. We’re not happy about it. We’re not happy about it at all, Kristen. Okay. One or two more. Yeah?
--
Donald Trump: (02:03:36)
No happy talk today.
--
Donald Trump: (02:03:50)
Why would you say no?
--
Donald Trump: (02:03:53)
I think the answer is yes. Who said no to that?
--
Donald Trump: (02:03:56)
No, no, you’re saying no, but who said no? You’re asking me do we have enough masks? Yes.
--
Donald Trump: (02:04:02)
No, you didn’t say that. You said, do we have enough masks? Do we have enough tests? Yes. Plus we developing new tests. Do we have enough ventilators? Yes. Do we have enough hospital beds? Yes. We’ve built 20,000 hospital beds. We have enough hospital beds. Go ahead Jim. Let’s go.
--
Donald Trump: (02:04:22)
You know what I say.
--
Donald Trump: (02:04:23)
Well, a lot of it’s fake news.
--
Donald Trump: (02:04:24)
A lot of it’s fake news-
--
Donald Trump: (02:04:29)
The governors reported-
--
Donald Trump: (02:04:34)
Yeah, depending on your air, they always say that because otherwise you’re not going to put them on. Let me just tell you. The governors have said last night, they had a group of governors, 14 governors. They went together someplace and they said, “It’s been unbelievable what’s happened. We’ve been totally responsive. Ventilators. Everyone has the ventilators they need.” To a point where we’re getting calls from foreign countries saying, “You have all the ventilators. Can we get some?” And we’re going to try and help some of these countries. These people have done an incredible job. This is not happy talk. Maybe it’s happy talk for you. It’s not happy talk for me. We’re talking about death. We’re talking about the greatest economy in the world, one day I have to close it off and we did the right thing because maybe it would have been two million people died instead of whatever that final number will be, which could be 60, it could be 70, it could be 75, could be 55.
--
Donald Trump: (02:05:25)
Thousands of people have died, there’s nothing happy about it, Jim. This is sad talk. This is the saddest … These are the saddest … These are the saddest news conferences that I’ve ever had. I don’t like doing them. You know why? Because I’m talking about death. I’m talking about taking the greatest economy ever created, we had the greatest numbers we’ve ever had in almost every aspect of economics, from employment to companies. Look at the airlines, they were having the best year. Now all of a sudden we have to save them. Okay, there’s no happy talk, Jim. This is the real deal and I’ve got to make the biggest decision of my life, and I’ve only started thinking about that. I mean, I’ve made a lot of big decisions over my life. You understand that. This is by far the biggest decision of my life because I have to say, “Okay, let’s go. This is what we’re going to do.”
--
Donald Trump: (02:06:18)
Sure. But you have many doctors that say unbelievable job. I watched this morning and I watched a certain network and it wasn’t Fox and you had doctors saying that we’ve done an incredible job. You just read off these no, no, no. Well, we have ventilators, we have equipment, we have beds. How about beds? I mean, Governor Cuomo just told me a little while ago, he’s got plenty of beds. In fact, they are having a hard time filling Javits Center. We built them 2,900 beds. So that’s not a fair question.
--
Donald Trump: (02:06:57)
No, no. Excuse me. We have masks, we have everything, and we were trying to get ready for the search and a lot of people said, “It will never happen.” Deborah said it, you’ll never need that many beds. They said we needed 40,000 ventilators, 40,000 it’s like building a car. 40,000 ventilators. People said, I felt it too, you’ll never need that many. Guess what? We have tremendous … We’re the envy of the world in terms of ventilators. Germany would like some, France would like some, we’re going to help countries out. Spain needs them desperately. Italy needs them desperately. Mexico needs them desperately.
--
Donald Trump: (02:07:38)
He asked me last night, “Would it be possible to get 10,000 ventilators” within a short period of time, I’ll be able to help out Mexico. No Jim, just the opposite of your question. It’s not, no, no, no. It’s yes, yes, yes. We’re in great shape and you know what? What’s happening now is those numbers are horrible, but take a look at the number of beds. We have beds available all over New York, New York really being the epicenter. New York has experienced something that has been absolutely horrific. I saw Hart’s Island yesterday. I saw those people being buried yesterday.
--
Donald Trump: (02:08:14)
Fortunately, we have the beds and you can speak to Mayor de Blasio. You can speak to Governor Cuomo. People can’t even believe the job we’ve done. They can’t even believe it, and I give tremendous credit to the military .. There’s been a military operation with private people, but wait a minute, wait, wait. I give tremendous credit to our military, to the Army Corps of Engineers, to FEMA, to these people. The job they’ve is incredible, and you shouldn’t be asking that kind of a question, Jim, honestly-
--
Donald Trump: (02:08:50)
I really don’t believe you’re that bad a guy, you shouldn’t be asking that kind of a question. You should say, “You know what? It’s been really incredible what’s been happening.” Jim. Nobody’s asking. What governor … Let me ask you this. What governor? We have more tests than anybody in the world. We have every … We have virtually every country in the world calling us, asking us, “How do we get these tests that you have? Your testing is the best in the world. How do we get it?” They’ve done a fantastic job. And when you ask a question like that, it’s very insulting to a lot of great people. Okay, one more, please. Please Doug.

Donald Trump: (02:09:34)
Sweden’s is different.
--
Donald Trump: (02:09:39)
I could’ve followed that approach. And if we did follow that approach, I think we might have two million people dead and Sweden is having a lot of difficulty. Look, I’m very friendly with the leadership in Sweden. They took a different approach. They’re a very disciplined country to start off with, but they did take it different, and other places tried it, UK tried it, the herd approach. Okay? Herd, and they tried it and you saw what happened in UK. It set them back a lot. A lot of time, it’s been having a tough time. Other countries have tried it and Sweden is suffering greatly. I mean, Sweden’s suffering greatly. If we did the herd, if we went with the herd as they say, we would have had potentially … I mean, you see the charts. Nobody knows. Nobody will ever know fortunately because we’re going to be substantially less than the minimum. I certainly hope, unless something happens that would be tragic.
--
Donald Trump: (02:10:39)
So they had a minimum number. If we did … One of the reasons were so far below that number is because nobody thought the American people could be so disciplined. Nobody thought it was possible. And I guess when they watched us up here every day and they watched other people and they listened to their representatives and governors, nobody thought that the American people could be so disciplined. They’ve been unbelievable. And because of that, so you have a minimum number of 100,000, and then you had the 2.2 number that if we did nothing, if we just kept working, everybody go to work, people would be dropping dead on the subways. No. If we would have lost a million people … Take the 2.2 million and cut it in half, make it … Cut it in more than half, make it a million people.
--
Donald Trump: (02:11:28)
Okay? Now take that number and cut it in half. Make it 500,000 people. That’s if we did nothing. Right? It’s unacceptable. It’s too many people. So we spent more money on stimulus. Who cares by comparison? You take 2.2 you cut it in half, you cut it in half, you cut it in half, you keep cutting it in half. I don’t care what number you choose. 500,000, 400,000. Well, we’re going to have, we were talking 50, 60, 65 maybe, maybe. But if we would’ve done what one country tried and it has been very tough for them, you know that, very, very nasty, very tough. But if we would have done that here and again, you’ve got to remember UK tried it, and I was a little surprised and I watched it … They were going about what, two weeks? And they said, “We’ve got to stop.” Because it was … They were going to have a whole country infected.
--
Donald Trump: (02:12:25)
So with all of that being said, we’ve got to get back to work. We’ve got to get our country open, but we could have lost two million people. We could have lost one million people. We could have lost a half a million people if we would’ve lost 500,000 people … Now I’ll say this also from the standpoint of being president and vice president, and we’re up there and we’re doing that herd and we’re going to bullet through it. Do you honestly think people like Jim and yourself and other people would have … Jeff would’ve put up with it? As people are dying all over, they would have said, “This man is crazy.” Because the numbers, Tony, at a minimum would have been many, many times greater than the numbers we’re talking about.
--
Donald Trump: (02:13:07)
So I’m very honored by our decisions, all of us. We talk about it all the time. I said, “Do you want to let them just, you just ride it, you just ride it right through.” We would have lost potentially millions of people. Now it would have been unsustainable. It would have been impossible to do, and the American people have been so disciplined. It’s been my honor to be their president. I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again, I’ll say it always. It’s been my great honor to have been their president and I have a big decision coming up, and I only hope to God that it’s the right decision, but it’ll be based on the input from a lot of very talented people, very smart people, and people that love our country. Thank you all very much. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (11:23)
Thank you very much, everyone. Before I begin, I’d like to offer my condolences and best wishes to the people all across our great South who have endured deadly tornadoes and other severe weather in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, and South Carolina.
--
Donald Trump: (11:42)
My administration will do everything possible to help those communities get back on their feet. We’re speaking with their governors and representatives. FEMA’s already on its way and they got there. As soon as we heard the word. I said, “Get out there.” So FEMA’s there and you know the great job that FEMA does, it’s really something very special. So we just want to say warmest condolences and we’re with you all the way. It’s a tough deal. That was a bad, bad level five. That was a bad group. That’s as high as it gets. It was a bad grouping of tornadoes, something that’s something incredible, the power, the horrible, destructive power.
--
Donald Trump: (12:26)
America is continuing to make critical progress at our war against the virus. Over the weekend, the number of daily new infections remained flat. Nationwide flat. Hospitalizations are slowing in hotspots like New York, New Jersey, Michigan and Louisiana. This is clear evidence that our aggressive strategy to combat the virus is working and that Americans are following the guidelines. It’s been incredible what they’ve done.
--
Donald Trump: (12:54)
You looked at the charts, and the charts are, and the models from early on predictions were 100 and 120,000 people look like if they did well, they were going to unfortunately perish. And we’re going to be hopefully way, way below that number. So that will be a sign of people doing things right, but it’s still just a horrible thing all over the world, 184 countries. This is attribute the wonderful healthcare advisors and experts who have been with us right from the beginning. We appreciate it so much. In fact, Dr. Fauci is here. Maybe I could ask Tony to say a few words before we go any further. Thank you very much, Tony. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (18:55)
And by the way, the travel ban, that was earlier. Travel ban was done earlier. And if you look at statistics, I happened to write a couple of them down, if you look at statistics… So on January 6th, that’s long before the dates you’re talking about, CDC issued a travel notice for Wuhan, China, a notice before there was even a confirmed case of the virus in the United States. That’s on January 6th. It’s all documented because we have so much fake news, I like to document things.
--
Donald Trump: (19:29)
January 6th long before the dates we’re talking about. CDC issued travel notice for Wuhan. On January 11th, we have zero cases in the United States. Zero. We don’t have any cases, so there are no cases reported that we know of. This is January 11th. The CDC issued a Level 1 travel notice for health while there were still no confirmed cases. So we had zero cases. People want me to act. I’m supposed to close down the economy, the greatest economy in the history of the world, and we don’t have one case confirmed in the United States. That’s January 11th.
--
Donald Trump: (20:10)
On January 17th to CDC began implementing public health entry screenings at three major U.S. Airports that received the greatest volume of passengers from Wuhan, at my instructions. There was not a single case of the coronavirus in the United States. So on January 17th, there wasn’t a case. And the fake news is saying, “Oh, he didn’t act fast enough.” Well, you remember what happened, because when I did act, I was criticized by Nancy Pelosi, by sleepy Joe Biden. I was criticized by everybody. In fact, I was called xenophobic. I was asking Biden to please define that for me. I was called other things by Democrats. And some others, not too many others actually, by the media, definitely.
--
Donald Trump: (20:58)
Now, on January 21st this is long before the time we’re talking, because when Tony’s talking, I believe he’s talking about the end of February. On January 21st, it was still early, there was one case of the virus at that time. We called it the Wuhan virus. Wuhan. There was one case in the whole United States. We had one case. This is all documented. It all comes from you. A lot of it comes from your people.
--
Donald Trump: (21:27)
On January 21st the CDC activated an emergency operation center. There was just one case, one person. That’s why that ad was such a phony. There was one person in the United States, you see it, there’s only one person, that statement was made at that time. One case in the whole United States, one case. I’m supposed to shut down the government, the biggest economy in the history of the world, shut it down. We have one case. Seven cases were on January 31st. Now in January 21st there was a case, not one person had died. You heard that Steve, right? Not one person.
--
Donald Trump: (22:08)
So we have this massive country, the United States of America. We have the greatest economy in the world. Bigger than China’s by a lot, right? Because of what we’ve done over the last three and a half years, prior to the virus, but including the virus. So we have the biggest economy, the greatest economy we’ve ever had, the highest employment numbers, the best employment numbers, best unemployment numbers, also, the best of everything. So on January 31st, think of it, not one person has died. Not one. Nobody died. Not one, John, I don’t think you’ll find any.
--
Donald Trump: (22:46)
This is reported by CDC, confirmed by the news, which doesn’t mean anything to me, because they don’t tell the truth. But CDC reported, January 31st not one person has died. And I issued a travel restriction from China. Think of it. So nobody died. And I issued, you can’t get earlier than that. So we have, nobody died. And I said, “China, you can’t come in. I’m sorry”, because I saw what was going on. Wasn’t so much what I was told, it was that I saw what was going on and I didn’t like it. But I didn’t speak to Tony about, didn’t speak to very many people about it. I didn’t like it. So what did I do?
--
Donald Trump: (23:28)
Ready? January 31st in the United States, not one person had died because of, again, the Wuhan virus, so I issued travel restrictions on that date, even though nobody died and I got brutalized over it by the press, because I was way too early. I shouldn’t have done it. Brutalized by the press, but I’ve been brutalized for the last four years. I used to do well before I decided to run for politics, but I guess I’m doing okay, because to the best of my knowledge, I’m the president of the United States despite the things that are said.
--
Donald Trump: (24:06)
So then, first mandatory quarantine in more than 50 years, we did. First mandatory in 50 years. The same restrictions that the Democrats in the media called xenophobic. Now Joe Biden said he’s a racist. Call me a racist, because I said, “We’re shutting down entry from China. We’re shutting it down.” He called me xenophobic and he called me a racist and other things. Since then, on a Friday night, two weeks ago, Joe Biden issued a… It wasn’t him. He didn’t write it. I’m sure he doesn’t even know that it was issued.
--
Donald Trump: (24:46)
But the people from his campaign who are smart, people that write these little PR releases are pretty smart, reasonably good, not the best, but they’re not bad. But they issued a statement saying that Joe Biden agrees that that President Trump was right to close it down to China. Now he did that. Now he issued it on a Friday night. We’ve all heard about that, John, Friday nights, right?
--
Donald Trump: (25:07)
In fact, his was later Friday night than I ever released mine on Friday nights. Okay? [Crosstalk 00:25:12] So he did it pretty late, at like at 11 o’clock in the evening or something, it’s pretty late. Anyway, so Joe Biden issued, and it’s one of those things. But in February, Nancy Pelosi said, “We should come to Chinatown.” This is late February. “Come to Chinatown. We think it’s very safe. Come here. Let’s all have the big parade. Chinatown parade.” Probably referring to San Francisco, and that’s it. But I took this action early.
--
Donald Trump: (25:42)
And so the story in the New York Times was a total fake. It’s a fake newspaper and they write fake stories. And someday, hopefully in five years when I’m not here, those papers are all going out of business, because nobody’s going to want to read them, but now they like them because they wrote about me. Now with that, I have a couple of interesting… We have a few clips that we’re just going to put up. We could turn the lights a little bit lower. I think you’ll find them interesting and then we’ll answer some questions. I’ll ask you some questions, because you’re so guilty, but forget it. But most importantly, we’re going to get back onto the reason we’re here, which is the success we’re having. OK, please. You can put it on. Thank you.
--
Donald Trump: (15:39)
Well, we’ve asked them to accelerate whatever they’re doing in terms of a vaccine.
--
Donald Trump: (15:43)
We will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days.
--
Donald Trump: (15:49)
To unleash the full power of the federal government through this effort today, I am officially declaring a national emergency.
--
Donald Trump: (15:55)
Medicare patients can now visit any doctor by phone or video conference at no additional cost.
--
Donald Trump: (16:03)
Video Woman: (16:09)
--
Donald Trump: (18:37)
So we could give you hundreds of clips like that from governors, including Democratic, or Democrat as I call them, governors, which is actually the correct term. We could give you hundreds of clips just like that. We have them. We didn’t want this to go on too long, but I just want to say it’s very sad when people write false stories, like in that case, I guess it was gotten mostly from The New York Times, which is a highly… I mean if you had libel laws, they would have been out of business even before they’ll end up going out of business, so it’s too bad. But we could have given you some other statements. We have hundreds of statements, hundreds of statements, including from Democrats and Democrat governors, and if you look, they were all saying, “We need ventilators.”
--
Donald Trump: (19:27)
You don’t hear ventilators anymore. They have all the ventilators they need, which we were right about. We said, “You’re asking for too many. You don’t need that.” And in all fairness, these two people right here, Dr. Birx, Dr. Fauci, they said, “I don’t think they need that many ventilators.” I said, “I agree.” At one point, and I’m not docking in New York for this, but they were asking, you remember, 40,000 ventilators. And that’s more than they have all over the country, and we got them a lot of ventilators and nobody’s complained. We got them, as you know, beautiful. We built hospital rooms all over the country. The governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, was very nice. He said, “You know what? You don’t have to build the second hospital.” Because good news is happening. They’re not able to fill the beds. They needed two hospitals. We built one. It was perfect. We’re just starting the other.
--
Donald Trump: (20:20)
I called him up. I said, “Do you think we should build the second one? I don’t think you’re going to need it.” And you said, “Let me get back.” He got back, we didn’t need it. With Governor Cuomo, in all good spirit and faith, he wanted to have the Jacob Javits Center done, and we built 2,900 incredible beds, incredible. Then we made it COVID, or to be exactly accurate, COVID-19, which was a lot of work. We had to change the duct work. We had to seal up certain areas. We had to put areas of rooftop things over the beds. We did a lot of work, and we had it… but they never really had too much use for it. And they called also, Mayor de Blasio, rightfully he called. He said, “Would it be possible to get more medical help?”
--
Donald Trump: (21:10)
So now not only are we building facilities, they’re asking us to help because they’re unable to man it. And we got him the help. We got Mayor de Blasio a lot of help. Then when the Javits Center wasn’t used much, and then as you know, the Mercy, we took the Mercy and we took the Comfort. And we made them both Los Angeles and New York. We made them a COVID adaptable, which was not easy to do. And we didn’t get almost any people sent there. They didn’t need them at the beginning because they didn’t need it for anything but this because there were fewer accidents, fewer motorcycles, fewer everything. And what we did was an incredible job, but they didn’t need them. It turned out they were there, we were ready. You know the expression, they have an expression, “Ready, willing, and able.” We were ready, willing, and able. What the Army Corps of Engineers did was a miracle. What FEMA did was a miracle. What the doctors did, so I got a call two days ago from the mayor of New York. He said, “Could you help us even more with medical personnel?” And we sent, I think it was 448 doctors, nurses, and respiratory experts, real experts, and I got a call from the mayor and he said, “I want to tell you, incredible. These people are incredible.” He said, “They lifted the spirits of the hospital workers from New York City like nothing I’ve ever seen.” It was unbelievable, what he said was really appreciated, and I let them know that. I let the military people… He said, “They went in there so brave, so incredible. They lifted the spirits of everybody.” We did all of this work, but when you read the phony stories nobody acknowledges this.
--
Donald Trump: (22:51)
And it doesn’t have to be acknowledged from my standpoint, but it does have to be acknowledged from the great work that these doctors and nurses, the Army Corps of Engineers team, all these people, they’ve done this incredible job. And they shouldn’t be abused because you take a look at what’s happened, nobody’s asking for ventilators except outside of our country. Outside of our country, they’re calling me. Every country, they’re calling me. So many countries, and I’m going to try and help them because we have thousands of ventilators being built. But nobody’s asking for ventilators. Nobody’s asking for beds because we built hospitals. I think we built 20,000 beds in a period of a couple of weeks. The job they’ve done is incredible. With all of that being said, I’m getting along very well with the governors, and if I wasn’t… Mike Pence had a call today with the governors and it was like a 10.
--
Donald Trump: (23:42)
I said, “How was it?” He said, “It’s a 10.” He used one of my expressions actually, but he said it was a 10. And I’m sure you people were probably on the call, although you weren’t supposed to be, but you were sitting in somebody’s office listening to it because every time we have these… And you would know that for weeks those calls have been very good, but there wasn’t a raised voice. There wasn’t even a statement of, “We think you should do this or that.” I heard it was just a perfect phone call. It might not be reported that way. They’ll say, “I thought that somebody maybe slightly raised…” Didn’t even raise their voice. My only point of saying this because I want to get back to why we’re here, the press has not treated these incredible people who’ve done such a great job, they haven’t treated unfairly.
--
Donald Trump: (24:27)
They’re way off. We were way ahead of schedule, and remember this because The Times [inaudible 00:24:32] was a fake, but everything… Remember this, everything we did, I was criticized because I was too early. If I waited longer, you would have been critical. If I went way early, if I went three months earlier, I would have been criticized for being way too early. So with all of that being said, we understand it. I think I’ve educated a lot of people as to the press, and I would love to be able to say that we have a very honest press. Honestly, John, there’d be nothing I would be more proud of if the press would work, and I don’t mind being criticized. But not when they’re wrong. Not when people have done a great job. Yes?
--
Donald Trump: (25:23)
That was done by a group in the office, and it was done just by… we just put some clips together. I’ll bet you I have over a hundred more clips even better than them. They were just pieced together over the last two hours. That was just… Oh, we have far better than that. That’s nothing compared to some of them.
--
Donald Trump: (25:40)
Yeah, this was done by Dan and a group of people, and they just put it together in a period of probably less than two hours.
--
Donald Trump: (25:48)
Because we’re getting fake news, and I like to have it corrected. They’re saying what a great job we’re doing, these are the governors of California, governor of New Jersey, governor of New York. Look in New York, we work very close with Andrew. In New York, ventilators were going to be a problem. They didn’t have a problem. We got them tremendous numbers of… thousands, but we got them tremendous number of ventilators. You don’t hear ventilators are a problem. Beds were going to be a problem. I mean, I’m happy about it. The Javits Center, which is incredible, is almost empty because they don’t need them. That’s good news, not bad news. I’m not saying, “Gee, I wish more people were there.” I don’t want more people there. We brought in the boat. We brought in the Comfort, and the Comfort was originally not supposed to be for this at all, the coronavirus, was not supposed to be for that at all.
--
Donald Trump: (26:36)
They called, they said, “Could we have it?” That was a number of weeks ago. We said, “We don’t think you need it, but if you need it, we’ll do it.” Then they said, “Could you get the medical personnel to run the Javits Center? Could you get the medical personnel to run the ship?” We said, “If it’s necessary, we will, and we did.” There were military personnel. That’s the ones that Mayor de Blasio was so great to in terms of his statements. I mean, I really appreciated his statements. He was so impressed with them, and I am too. The level of genius and bravery, they’re great people, the military people, and we pieced that together. I would say it took less than two hours. It was done in-house. Steve?
--
Donald Trump: (27:20)
I wouldn’t use the word produced. All they did was took some clips, and they just ran them for you. And the reason they did is to keep you honest. Now, I don’t think that’s going to work. It’s not going to have any impact, but just think of it. You heard the clips, you heard what I said. They said I acted late on closing down the country. Some people wish we never closed it down. Now if we didn’t, we would have lost hundreds of thousands of people interestingly, so I’m against it. We did the right thing. Everything we did was right. If we would have closed down-
--
Donald Trump: (27:51)
Well look, governors should have had ventilators. They chose not to have them. We were able to get them ventilators. You haven’t heard other than there was a lot of panic, a lot of screaming, “We want ventilators.” They got the ventilators. You don’t have that anymore, and the surge is supposed to be coming now. And if they do need ventilators, John, we’ve got almost 10,000 that are ready to rock. We have people standing with those ventilators right now. If you needed 2000 in New York, which you don’t, but if you did, we can have them here in less than 24 hours. We’re ready to rock. [crosstalk 00:28:24] This was a great military and beyond that operation. Let’s get back to the regular. Well shouldn’t we get back to the regular?
--
Donald Trump: (28:31)
We can talk about this, but all I’m doing is this, I could have given you… Those are four or five clips that we just played for you, I could have given you hundreds of people. Gavin was on television two days ago with one of your competitors singing praise. The question was asked in a negative way. He said, “Look, I know what you want me to say, but he’s been really good. It’s hard for me to say that. In fact, it’s impossible for me to say.”
--
Donald Trump: (29:02)
Gavin Newsom, the governor of California. I have many clips. I have some clips from Anthony that I didn’t want to put up, which were really good. I think Anthony would be the first one to say when I closed the country to China, the China ban, whatever you want to call it, Anthony said I saved a lot of lives by doing that. I mean, am I correct? I don’t want to put words in Anthony’s mouth, by the way, and I like him. Today I walk in, I hear I’m going to fire him. I’m not firing him. I think he’s a wonderful guy. [crosstalk 00:00:29:32]. I retweeted somebody, I don’t know. They said fire, doesn’t matter.
--
Donald Trump: (29:41)
Yeah, I notice everything.
--
Donald Trump: (29:46)
Well, no, that’s somebody’s opinion. All that is is a opinion.
--
Donald Trump: (29:50)
Well, I was called about that. I said, “I’m not firing.” In fact, if you ask your friends in the public relations office, I was immediately called upon that, and I said, “No, I like him. I think he’s terrific.” Because this was a person’s view. Not everybody’s happy with Anthony. Not everybody’s happy with everybody, but I will tell you, we have done a job the likes of which nobody has ever done. The mobilization, getting of equipment, all of the things we’ve done, nobody’s ever done a job like this. We have 50 governors and territories, by the way, people don’t ever mention that. We have territories. We have 50 governors and territories, and many of those governors are Democrats. And they can’t find anything to complain about, and honestly, many of them didn’t do their jobs. I’ll let you know someday. Let’s see what happens, but I may let you know who’s not doing their job.
--
Donald Trump: (30:41)
I can tell you the ones that are good, both Republican and Democrat, and the ones who don’t know what they’re doing. But we help some of the ones that don’t know what they’re doing. They should have had their own stockpiles, and now if they want, we can build them stockpiles of ventilators. The hardest thing is the ventilator because it’s expensive. It takes a while to get. We got them and nobody believed we did. Now, many of the governors were asking for far too many, and we said they were asking for far too many. We talked and we said, you said very strongly that they just don’t need that, but you said they don’t need that many beds, Deborah. So that’s it. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (31:21)
Yeah, we have been from the beginning. I don’t know what it is exactly, but if I put somebody’s opinion up, I don’t mind controversy. I think controversy is a good thing, not a bad thing, but I want it to be honest controversy. Now, when I got a call, I got a call not very quickly, and nobody saw that as being any big deal. They said, “How are you doing with Dr. Fauci?” I said, “I’m doing great,” and I didn’t talk to Dr. Fauci even until we just got here. Dr. Fauci asked one of the people if he could get up and speak, and he did. [crosstalk 00:31:53] And they totally misinterpreted him. I saw what they did.
--
Donald Trump: (32:06)
Here’s the thing. Now what he really is saying though, but how could you have done it? Look, I just went over stats with you, right? Here, right here. How do you close it up? You have no deaths and no cases, on January 11th. Doctor, would you recommend closing the United States of America? Oh, this must be terrible. How many cases do we have? None. How many deaths do we have? None. January 17th, go back another week. On January 17th, this is 10 days before I did the, little bit less than 10 days, before I did the ban. I did a ban on China. You think that was easy? I then did a ban on Europe and a lot of people said that was an incredible thing to do because you look at Spain, and by the way, we’re doing very well because when you look at all of those flat graphs and you add it all up, the United States is very low.
--
Donald Trump: (32:54)
And per capita we’re very low. We’re doing very well. But how do you close up the United States of America? So on January 6th, no deaths. On January 11th, no deaths, and no cases. On January 17th, no cases, no cases, no deaths. I’m supposed to close up the United States of America when I have no cases.
--
Donald Trump: (33:19)
I closed down from China. Excuse me, I closed it down from China. And by the way, some people think I should have waited longer and maybe ridden it out. I disagree with them, okay? But it was thought of. I mean, that was an alternative. You know, there are a lot of people that would’ve said, “Let’s ride it out.” Now, I’ll give you the good news. If I would have done that, it would have been, I think, catastrophic, because their numbers are, Anthony, 1.6 to 2.2 million people would have died if we tried to do that. And I did this last time, cut it in half.
--
Donald Trump: (33:54)
Don’t say 2.2 million. Cut it in more than half, say a million people died. Well, that’s much more than the Civil War. Cut it in half. Take the million and cut it in half. That’s 500,000 people would have died. Now that number we would’ve reached, okay? That would have been easy to reach if we did nothing. So we did the right thing and our timing was very good. But here’s the one thing, and you have to say this. When you asked me, “Why didn’t you do this?” How come when I did the ban on China, and instituted some very tough things, how come Nancy Pelosi, a month later, is in Chinatown saying, “Let’s all march. This is not going to happen.” How come we have many of the experts from CNN and many other networks, if you call CNN a network, I don’t personally, but we have CNN, we have many other places, and they’re all saying he doesn’t need to do it. He doesn’t need to do it.
--
Donald Trump: (34:50)
All I’m saying is this, how do you close down the greatest economy in the history of the world, when on January 17th, you have no cases and no death. When on January 21st, you have one case and no death. One case, think of that. Now we’re supposed to close down the country? But here’s what happened. When on January 31st, I instituted the ban, Joe Biden went crazy. He said, “You don’t need the ban.” He didn’t go crazy. He didn’t even know what the hell the ban was, so he didn’t go crazy. But he did say, [crosstalk 00:35:24] he did call me xenophobic, wait a minute, he called me xenophobic. He called me a racist because… He has since apologized and he said I did the right thing.
--
Donald Trump: (35:34)
So when you say, why didn’t you do this? Every Democrat thought I made a mistake when I did it. I saved tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of lives [crosstalk 00:35:43] by him.
--
Donald Trump: (35:50)
You’re so disgraceful. It’s so disgraceful the way you say that. Let me just, listen. I just went over it.
--
Donald Trump: (35:59)
I just went over it. Nobody thought we should do it, and when I did it-
--
Donald Trump: (36:10)
You know what we did? What do you do when you have no case in the whole United States?
--
Donald Trump: (36:18)
Excuse me. You reported it. Zero cases, zero deaths on January 17th-
--
Donald Trump: (36:25)
I said in January.
--
Donald Trump: (36:27)
On January 30th-
--
Donald Trump: (36:33)
A lot.
--
Donald Trump: (36:33)
A lot, and in fact, we’ll give you a list. What we did, in fact, part of it was up there.
--
Donald Trump: (36:37)
We did a lot. Look, look, you know you’re a fake. You know that. Your whole network, the way you cover it is fake, and most of you, and not all of you, but the people are wise to you. That’s why you have a lower approval rating than you’ve ever had before times probably three.
--
Donald Trump: (36:54)
And when you asked me that question, let me ask you this, why did Biden apologize? Why did he write a letter of apology?
--
Donald Trump: (37:03)
No, that’s very important. Why did the Democrats think that I acted too quickly? You know why? Because they really thought that I acted too quickly. We have done a great job [crosstalk 00:05:12]. Now I could have, I could have kept it open and I could have done what some countries are doing. They’re getting beat up pretty badly. I could have kept it open. I thought of keeping it open because nobody’s ever heard of closing down a country, let alone the United States of America. But if I would’ve done that, we would’ve had hundreds of thousands of people that would right now be dead. We’ve done this right, and we really have done this right. The problem is the press doesn’t cover it the way it should be. Go ahead. One more question, Steve. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (37:53)
Well, I have the ultimate authority, but we’re going to get into that in a minute. We’re going to just finish this up. We’re going to tell you about other things that we’ve done right, but I will say this, had we said, “Let’s just keep going and let’s not do a closing,” whether it’s 2.2 that they at one point predicted as an outside, or 1.6 at a lower number, you cut it all the way down to six or seven or 800,000, take just a fraction of the number that could have happened, it literally would have been more than the Civil War. It would have been a disaster. So the minimal number was 100,000, and I think, I feel pretty good that we’re going to be substantially below, Anthony, the hundred thousand, and I hope we will.
--
Donald Trump: (38:33)
All right, so today the Department of Health and Human Services announcing five new contracts to procure large numbers of additional ventilators under the Defense Production Act, which we used a lot by the way, which you didn’t like to talk about, in addition to the 1,300 we received today. We received today 1,300 additional ventilators.
--
Donald Trump: (38:55)
Now we’re probably not going to need them, but we can add that to our stockpile, which is very big and we can move it around should the surge take place and should it be a very substantial surge. We’re ready to rock. The contracts are with General Electric, Hill-Rom, Medtronic, Resmed, and VIAIR combined with the DPA contracts that we announced last week with General Motors and Phillips, and two other contracts with Hamilton and Zole, we’re adding 6,190 ventilators to the strategic national stockpile of which we have a lot already, thousands, close to 10,000, but this will be added by May 8th, another 29,000 by the end of May, and more than 120,000 total we will have by the end of the year. Now we’re going to help other countries. We’re going to help states if they need it. We may help some state stockpile.
--
Donald Trump: (39:49)
You know, they’re supposed to buy their own stockpile. They have state stockpiles. They’re supposed to be using that and unfortunately most of the states weren’t there, and a lot of people didn’t want to talk about it, but they weren’t there. We will talk about it the right time if you want to. I, at this point, I’m more focused on getting past this nightmare of a epidemic or a pandemic, anything you want to call it. We got to get past it. No one who has needed a ventilator has not gotten a ventilator. Think of that. You know, you heard all about ventilators, ventilators, we need ventilators, because they didn’t have them, because the states should’ve had them. No one who has needed a ventilator has not gotten a ventilator. No one who has needed a hospital bed has been denied a hospital bed. That’s not even really our responsibility.
--
Donald Trump: (40:34)
Now if we can help, we’re going to do it, but that’s where the Army Corps of Engineers did such a great job. We built over 20,000 beds. In fact, we built thousands more than we’ve actually needed to be safe. We wanted to be safe, and they rose to this incredible occasion. I mean, we built more beds than we thought. We thought in Louisiana, we were going heavy. And again, when I called the Governor, I said, “Maybe we shouldn’t build that second hospital because we don’t want to build it if you don’t need it.” He called back, he said, “I don’t think we’re going to need it.” They had a thousand rooms, a thousand beds, and they used a lot of them, but they didn’t need the other ones, so we stopped it because we don’t want to waste. But we’re prepared to build thousands more, should we need it. I don’t think we’re going to need it because it looks like we’re plateauing and maybe even in many cases coming down.
--
Donald Trump: (41:21)
In addition, we’ve ordered a total of 16 mobile decontamination systems. So the decontamination is system from Battelle, Ohio, is an incredible thing because it takes the masks and up to 20 times you can decontaminate a mask. And I’ve been asking from the beginning, “Why can’t we sterilize and sanitize these masks?” And it turned out we can, and there was a great company in Ohio. They sent us some great equipment and they’re doing that now, and now we’re going to have more than 33 million N95 masks per week will be cleaned, decontaminated, and it’ll be great. It’s something that frankly, I think people should have thought of a long time ago.
--
Donald Trump: (42:07)
Five more flights landed today as part of the Project Air Bridge, our massive airless lift operation to bring personal protective equipment into the United States, which has now delivered nearly half a million N95 masks, 370 million gloves, 25 million surgical masks and 4.9 million gowns. So we have millions of gowns, gloves, masks, all surgical equipment coming in should the states need it. Now the states are supposed to be buying their own stuff, but should they need it, we are ready to give them because we’re building up our stockpile again like crazy.
--
Donald Trump: (42:44)
Remember, and you saw the stories, I inherited this administration, Mike, myself, the whole administration. We inherited a stockpile where the cupboards were bare. There was nothing, and I say it and I’ll say it again, just like we didn’t have ammunition, we didn’t have medical supplies, we didn’t have ventilators, we didn’t have a lot of things that should have been had, and you can read your own stories on that because you know what happened. They didn’t want to spend the money, but we did. To date, we’ve facilitated the supply of more than 38 million N95 masks nationwide. This week we’ll be sending two million N95 masks to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Vice President will go into more detail. He’s got great detail on that and I think it’s a pretty amazing story. We have a lot of masks already in stock and we have more coming.
--
Donald Trump: (43:35)
We’re further expanding hospital surge capacity in key areas of the opening, and we have a portion of certain VA hospitals and non-veteran coronavirus patients including at the East Orange New Jersey Medical Center as well as facilities in Manhattan and Brooklyn. They’re ready, they’re able, they’re beautiful. Hopefully we won’t need too many of them because frankly we built everything that the governors wanted and in many cases it’s too much. We told them it was too much, but we wanted to err on the side of caution.
--
Donald Trump: (44:06)
The United States has now conducted nearly 3 million tests for the virus, 3 million, the most of any nation. We’re performing approximately 115,000 tests every single day, and our rate of testing is especially high in areas hardest hit by the virus. If you look, and it’s hit some areas of the virus, very, very hard. For example, per capita testing in New York is higher than the rest of the world. The NIH, CDC and FDA are also currently validating several antibody tests that will allow us to determine whether someone has already had the virus and potentially become immune to infection. We’re looking at that. The antibody tests are going to be very interesting over the next short while. A lot of things are being developed as we speak.
--
Donald Trump: (44:54)
In the race to develop effective treatments, the drug company Gilead announced that its drug Remdesivir has shown promising results, very promising in compassionate use settings. In addition, the FDA has just granted Emergency Use Authorization for a device that removes certain proteins from the bloodstream, possibly preventing a patient’s immune system from overreacting to the virus and damaging vital organs, which is a big problem.
--
Donald Trump: (45:23)
Furthermore, over the last seven days, my administration has deployed roughly 28 million doses of hydroxychloroquine from our national stockpile. We have millions of doses that we bought and many people are using it all over the country. And just recently a friend of mine told me he got better because of the use of that drug. So, who knows? And you combine it with Z-Pak, you combine it with zinc depending on your doctor’s recommendation, and he’s having some very good results. I’ll tell you, I think of anybody recommended it other than me, it would be used all over the place, to be honest with you. I think the fact that I recommended it, I probably set it back a lot. But it’s a lot of good things are happening with it, a lot of good tests.
--
Donald Trump: (46:07)
Scientists are also pursuing a blood therapy known as a convalescent plasma, convalescent plasma. This therapy uses antibodies from the blood of recovered patients to treat those who are sick, and this is something that actually is a very old procedure, but it’s done in a very modern way. During this difficult time, we’re also working to ensure that the 2020 census is completed safely and accuracy. We may be asking for an extension because obviously they can’t be doing very much right now. They wouldn’t even be allowed to do it. So the census, we’re going to be asking for a delay, a major delay, I think. How can you possibly be knocking on doors for a long period of time now? The Census Bureau recently made the decision to temporary suspend its field operation data collection activities to help stop the spread. In addition, while millions of Americans continue to complete their questionnaire online, the Census Bureau has asked Congress for a 120 extension.
--
Donald Trump: (47:07)
I don’t know that you even have to ask them. This is called an act of God. This is called a situation that has to be, they have to give, and I think 120 days isn’t nearly enough. My administration’s also taking bold action to help American workers. On Friday, Americans began receiving the cash payments authorized by a historic $2 trillion relief bill. By the end of the week, nearly 80 million Americans will receive a total of $147 billion and from what the Secretary of the Treasury tells me, that’s very much on time and going very nicely. He’ll be speaking in a moment. In payments, these payments go directly into the banks and the bank accounts of these people. Millions of additional payments will follow. The typical family of four will receive $3,400, that’s for a family of four. That’s something. Additionally through our paycheck protection program, which is a tremendous success, and they should extend it and increase-
--
Donald Trump: (48:03)
… tremendous success, and they should extend it and increase it. This has been a tremendous success. So successful that the banks should take it a little bit longer to distribute the money, but it’s going rapidly.
--
Donald Trump: (48:12)
We’ve now processed over $200 billion in loans to help small businesses retain their workers. Now we urgently need lawmakers to set aside the partisan agendas and to replenish this program with new funds, because it’s really something that has been an incredible success and they need more money to keep it going, to take care of these business and keep them open.
--
Donald Trump: (48:35)
I want to thank the many governors, health professionals, scientists, and business leaders for their incredible hard work and input over the past month. And even long beyond a month, Mike, I would say. We’ve been working together with a lot of them for it seems like forever.
--
Donald Trump: (48:50)
I’ve been having many discussions with my team and top experts. We’re very close to completing a plan to open our country, hopefully even ahead of schedule. That’s so important. We will soon finalize new and very important guidelines to give governors the information they need to start safely opening their states. My administration’s plan and corresponding guidelines will give the American people the confidence they need to begin returning to normal life. That’s what we want. We want to have our country open, we want to return to normal life. Our country’s going to be open. It’s going to be successfully opened. We’ll be explaining over a very short number of days exactly what is going to be.
--
Donald Trump: (49:35)
We’ve also, as you probably heard, developed a committee. We’re actually calling in a number of committees with the most prominent people in the country, the most successful people in the various fields. We’ll be announcing them tomorrow.
--
Donald Trump: (49:49)
This weekend, the United States also helped facilitate an unprecedented agreement among the 23 nations of OPEC-Plus. That’s OPEC plus additional energy producing nations, representing many of the world’s largest oil producing countries to stabilize all markets. We have, in fact, and I think you’ve seen, a big stabilization over the last couple of days. Together, countries around the world will cut oil production by approximately 20 million barrels. People are saying 10 million, but we think that the number that they’ll actually hit is going to be closer to 20 million barrels a day. That will help a lot with saving jobs all over Texas, and Oklahoma, and North Dakota, and many other of our big energy states.
--
Donald Trump: (50:33)
This historic action will help nearly 11 million American workers who are supported by the US oil and gas industry. It’s a very monumental agreement. I want to thank Saudi Arabia and the king of Saudi Arabia, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, both. I want to thank President Putin of Russia. And I want to thank a very good friend of mine, man who’s become a friend of mine, the president of Mexico showed great flexibility. President Lopez Obrador. He showed great flexibility and tremendous intelligence doing what he did. It was not that easy for him, and I want to thank Mexico and the president. This is a very historic deal, very historic, so we’ll see how it all goes.
--
Donald Trump: (51:18)
In this time and challenge, and we are certainly in a time probably like we haven’t been in many, many decades, we are strengthened and sustained by the bonds of love and loyalty that unite all Americans. I’m so proud of the American people. Everywhere you look, you see the patriotism of our people shining through, and the courage of our doctors and nurses on the front lines, and the dedication of our food supply workers, and in the commitment of every citizen to achieving victory over the virus. That’s what’s going to happen. It’s going to happen sooner than people think.
--
Donald Trump: (51:54)
We’re going to be smart about it. Very, very smart about it. We’re going to be safe about it. We’re going to be listening also to the great doctors and medical professionals. Together, we’re beating back the invisible enemy, and we’re paving the way for great resurgence. It’s really a great resurgence, the American prosperity. Our country wants to go back. They want to go back to work. They’re going to go back safely. That’s what we want.
--
Donald Trump: (52:18)
I’d like now to ask Vice President Pence to say a few words, followed by Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx. I think before we do this, because I know there’s an emergency where they want Steve to come. So what I’ll do is I’ll ask Steve to come up, secretary of the treasury. You can talk a little bit, and then maybe take a couple of questions about what’s happening. Tell them the success we’re having. Thank you very much.
--
Donald Trump: (55:54)
Do you have any questions for Steve, press?
--
Donald Trump: (57:20)
Negotiation.
--
Donald Trump: (58:47)
Everything has to be safe. We want safe.
--
Donald Trump: (59:09)
Well, I’ll be doing that over the next few days, because we’ll probably be making a statement about that and exactly what it looks like. I know what that looks like, but I also want to get the advice, in a sense. We have some of the biggest from every business on this council. We’re actually setting up a number of different councils or committees, I guess you could call them. We have a lot of smart people. I think that they will give us some also good advice. But no, we want to be very, very safe. At the same time, we’ve got to get our country open.
--
Donald Trump: (59:49)
I do think so. Eventually, they will. Yeah. We hope so.
--
Donald Trump: (59:53)
I think eventually they will do that. I think we’re going to boom. I think it’s going to go quickly. Our people want to get back to work, and I think there’s a pent up demand like there hasn’t been in a long time.
--
Donald Trump: (01:00:06)
That’s why you see the stock market… I mean, to think that the stock market’s at the level it is right now with all that this world and this country has gone… And look at the European Union, how badly decimated they’ve been. Look at other countries. Look at China, by the way. I’ve seen the numbers. Look at China. Look at how these countries have been just decimated by this. And to think that the stock market is at this tremendously high number. Not that much… It was looking a little bleak for a while, but it hit a certain point and then started going up. I think that’s a great tribute to the fact that there’s a demand. Yeah.
--
Donald Trump: (01:00:54)
Numerous provisions. We’ll give you a legal brief if you want.
--
Donald Trump: (01:01:08)
Well, I think everybody wants to open. I mean, I guess-
--
Donald Trump: (01:01:12)
I guess that could happen, but I don’t think that would happen.
--
Donald Trump: (01:01:21)
That’s because I let that happen, because I would’ve preferred that. I let that happen. But if I wanted to, I could have closed it up. But I let that happen. I like the way they’ve done it.
--
Donald Trump: (01:01:29)
The seven that remained, really, in sort of a semi-lockdown, if you look at those states, they’ve really done a very good job. They’re very much different from a New York or from other places where they’ve been hit very hard. Go ahead, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:01:44)
Go ahead, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:00)
Well they can decide, but-
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:03)
No, not at all. Let me just tell you very simple. I’m going to put it very simply. The president of the United States has the authority to do what the president has the authority to do, which is very powerful. The president of the United States calls the shots. If we weren’t here for the states, you would have had a problem in this country like you’ve never seen before. We were here to back them up, and we’ve more than backed them up. We did a job that nobody ever thought was possible. It’s a decision for the president of the United States.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:31)
Now, with that being said, we’re going to work with the states, because it’s very important. You have local governments. They’re pinpointed. It’s really, you talk about… It’s like a microchip. They’re pinpointed. We have local government that hopefully will do a good job. If they don’t do a good job, I’d step in so fast. But no, they can’t do anything without the approval of the president of the United States.
--
Donald Trump: (01:14:30)
Well if some states refuse to open, I would like to see that person run for election. They’re going to open. They’re going to all open.
--
Donald Trump: (01:14:38)
That’s something that’s not going to happen. They want to open. They have to open. They have to get open. Every one of those states, the people want to go and they want to … Now, some will be, are in a different situation. You have, I won’t name states now, but I will over the next two or three days. I’m going to be very specific, but you have some states where this is not the kind of a problem than it is in New York or Louisiana or Michigan or other places that got hit very hard. Illinois got hit very hard, but all states want to open and they want to open as soon as possible, but they want to open safely and so do I. Yeah please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:15:26)
No, France got hit very hard. France got hit very hard and again, he has to do what he has to do. He’s a friend of mine, but France, Spain has just been decimated. You look at what’s happened in Italy, it’s a very well known fact what happened in Italy. No, they were hit very hard.
--
Donald Trump: (01:16:59)
We’ve had very good [inaudible 00:13: 00].
--
Donald Trump: (01:17:04)
Steve I just want to say we have had discussion-
--
Donald Trump: (01:17:06)
Excuse me one second. We’ve had very good discussions with the airlines. Very good discussions.
--
Donald Trump: (01:17:15)
I don’t want to say that. You’ll be hearing over the next few days.
--
Donald Trump: (01:18:22)
And Steve, do you want to talk about Phase Four?
--
Donald Trump: (01:19:06)
When you say my authority, the president’s authority, not mine, because it’s not me. This is when somebody is the President of the United States, the authority is total and that’s the way it’s got to be.
--
Donald Trump: (01:19:19)
It’s total. It’s total-
--
Donald Trump: (01:19:20)
And the governors know that.
--
Donald Trump: (01:19:22)
The governors know that. Now you have a couple of bands of-
--
Donald Trump: (01:19:24)
Excuse me, excuse me.
--
Donald Trump: (01:19:26)
You have a couple of bands of Democrat governors, but they will agree to it. They will agree it.
--
Donald Trump: (01:19:35)
The authority of the President of the United States having to do with the subject we’re talking about is total. [crosstalk 01:19:41]. Yeah please go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:19:56)
At the right time.
--
Donald Trump: (01:19:58)
A very good question actually. Well, I would have to take a look. I wouldn’t say Italy’s doing great right now and I wouldn’t say Spain’s doing great right now and we just heard that France is extending its stay inside order. They’ve extended it. I just see that and I think for short period of time, but no. When they’re back, we want to do it very quickly, but we want to make sure everything’s good. No, right now we have a very strong ban. We’re going to keep it that way until they heal.
--
Donald Trump: (01:20:26)
Well, I can’t tell you that. I have to see. How are they doing? France just went for another two weeks. We have to see. John.
--
Donald Trump: (01:20:41)
Well, I’m not sure who … John, I’m not sure who really gave me advice on the ban. I think I took my own advice on the ban. I don’t know.
--
Donald Trump: (01:21:13)
I will and many other people also, but I will absolutely take their advice. Please go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:21:20)
I don’t think it would be likely because I think we’re not very far from being on the same page. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:21:36)
Well, they have to do it. [crosstalk 01:21:37] supposed to be [crosstalk 01:21:38].
--
Donald Trump: (01:21:42)
They may need help but-
--
Donald Trump: (01:21:43)
But they’re there. They’re on ground. They’ve got local mayors, local representatives. They have people that do it-
--
Donald Trump: (01:21:50)
And what we did last time is unprecedented. We literally rebuild tests. We rebuilt a whole industry because we inherited nothing. What we inherited from the previous administration was totally broken, which somebody should eventually say. Not only were the cupboards bare as I say, but we inherited broken testing. Now we have great testing. I just left the top executives at Abbott. Who would have thought that would have happened where they have such a great test as that?
--
Donald Trump: (01:22:18)
And in fact what I’ll do, I think unless you have any further questions for the Secretary of Treasury, do you have anybody for Steve? Anybody? Is that for the secretary of the treasury or for me? Because if it’s for me, we can wait.
--
Donald Trump: (01:22:29)
We have to get him back to work okay?
--
Donald Trump: (01:24:52)
[crosstalk 01:24:52] it’s been reported with the Kennedy Center just so you understand and that was done … The Democrats wanted it and we didn’t want that, but they wanted it in and we had to agree in order to get something done for the workers. But we want this to be for the workers and for companies that employ the workers. That’s what we’re looking for. We’re not looking for extraneous nonsense.
--
Donald Trump: (01:26:26)
But are you talking about the unemployment or you’re the unemployment?
--
Donald Trump: (01:26:30)
Sending it indirectly to the states. We would have preferred that it was sent directly to the people. The Democrats wanted it to be sent through the unemployment system. And I’ve talked to you about it, we have 40-year-old equipment in many of those systems that run by the state, but I’m hearing to getting the money out anyway.
--
Donald Trump: (01:26:58)
Phase Four Steve. Phase Four. Come on Steve.
--
Donald Trump: (01:27:10)
You know what we’re going to do? We’re going to write up papers on this. It’s not going to be necessary because the governors need us one way or the other, because ultimately, it comes with the federal government. That being said, we’re getting along very well with the governors and I feel very certain that there won’t be a problem. Yeah please, go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:27:32)
I haven’t asked anybody because-
--
Donald Trump: (01:27:36)
You know why? Because I don’t have to. Go ahead please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:27:36)
Enough. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:27:52)
It’s nice to have Governor Hogan very much. We appreciate Governor Hogan’s statement.
--
Donald Trump: (01:28:01)
Which one? Where is it?
--
Donald Trump: (01:28:08)
Well, they’re looking at things in Phase Four where they talk about states and they’re also talking about hospitals. They’re talking about States who have been battered and they’re also talking about hospitals and we’re certainly willing to look at that.
--
Donald Trump: (01:28:22)
We’ll see what we all come back with but they are talking about states and they’re talking about hospitals. [inaudible 00:24:29].
--
Donald Trump: (01:28:39)
The sale of what?
--
Donald Trump: (01:28:56)
Well I don’t think that’s going to happen. I think it’s very extreme, but she’s doing it and I think it’s going to be over a long way before we have to start thinking about it too much. It is strong. It’s a very strong position to take, but they’re making a lot of progress in Michigan, so let’s see how it all works out.
--
Donald Trump: (01:29:15)
We’re going to be talking about that very soon. I’m getting a full report. I’m not happy with the World Health Organization. Not happy with the World Trade Organization either. We’ve been ripped off by everybody. We have, this country, for so many years, has been ripped off by everybody, whether it’s the World Health or World Trade. They’re like, I call them, the Bobbsey Twins. They look at our country, for years and years, we had people that did nothing about it. We’re doing a lot about it. So we’ll have a report and we’ll also, we’re also talking about the World Trade Organization, but we’ve made a lot of progress there. We’re now winning cases for the first time because they know I’ll leave if we don’t get treated fairly.
--
Donald Trump: (01:29:52)
This country, our country, was at a point where we’ve rarely, if ever, won the lawsuits within the World Trade Organization, but now we’re winning a lot of them because they know I’m not playing games. We will pull out if we have to. We just won a $7 billion lawsuit, which was very nice.
--
Donald Trump: (01:30:14)
Yeah. I would say by the end of the week, I’m going to make a decision, yeah. Right now there’s a lot of things happening. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:30:27)
How do you know that there are no consequences?
--
Donald Trump: (01:30:28)
How do you know that there are no consequences?
--
Donald Trump: (01:30:30)
I wouldn’t tell you. China will find out. Why would I tell you?
--
Donald Trump: (01:30:35)
No, you started off by saying why are there no consequences?
--
Donald Trump: (01:30:41)
How do you know that there are no consequences?
--
Donald Trump: (01:30:44)
You’re going to find out.
--
Donald Trump: (01:30:45)
I wouldn’t tell you. You’d probably be the last person on earth I’d tell.
--
Donald Trump: (01:30:49)
Go ahead. Yeah, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:36:22)
[inaudible 01:36:24].
--
Donald Trump: (01:36:26)
You don’t know that yourself.
--
Donald Trump: (01:36:29)
[inaudible 01:36:31].
--
Donald Trump: (01:36:30)
We would like to have their cooperation, and we are going to have that cooperation. They will cooperate perfectly. Watch.
--
Donald Trump: (01:37:31)
All right, go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:37:37)
Barely. I hear you well.
--
Donald Trump: (01:37:52)
Well, we’re looking at that certainly. I heard that complaint, but the mayor seems to be very happy with everything we’ve done, and she was on today saying very good things. Okay, yeah. Go ahead in the back.
--
Donald Trump: (01:38:20)
It does, and I hope that won’t happen. I certainly hope that won’t happen, but it does weigh on my mind. Okay, in the back. Go ahead. Go ahead, yes.
--
Donald Trump: (01:38:29)
Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:38:57)
China has their own difficulties. We have a relationship with China that we’re not happy with certain things that happened over the last period of time, as you know, and I’ve been very explicit on that, but we know all about that and know China is … We’ve seen what they did. We’ve seen many other things that they’ve done both pro and constitution, and we’ll be just fine.
--
Donald Trump: (01:39:36)
I don’t want to say that, but we’re going to be putting our guidelines and recommendations fairly quickly in a few days.
--
Donald Trump: (01:39:44)
I’m not going to say it, but look. Certain states are doing very well. Certain big parts of the country are doing very well. They’re doing really very well, so we’re going to be putting out recommendations and guidelines very soon. Stay with us.
--
Donald Trump: (01:40:00)
See, I don’t want to tell you now, but right now we have a very strong indication that we know pretty much we have some good ideas. I also want to have … We’ll have video conference or at least a conference call with a lot of very good people having to do with certain fields, whether it’s energy or whether it’s entertainment and restaurants, et cetera, et cetera. We have to get people back into restaurants. We have to do what we have to do, whether it’s deductability or not. We’ll see, but it should be deductability. You’ll get them back so fast. I mean, they used to have deductability. The restaurant business, it was one of the hot businesses, and then they ended it a long time ago, many years ago, but we may need that to get people back into the restaurants.
--
Donald Trump: (01:40:56)
Absentee ballot are you talking about?
--
Donald Trump: (01:41:00)
Well, I don’t know what she did. I mean, I didn’t see that. When did that happen? Today?
--
Donald Trump: (01:41:05)
I wish her a lot of luck.
--
Donald Trump: (01:41:06)
Please, go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:41:28)
We discussed many things. We did discuss China. We discussed many different things, but it was primarily a call on the oil, as you can imagine, and they were very helpful in getting a stabilization price, a stabilization of the number of barrels. I think the number is going to be closer to 20, maybe 15, but closer to 20 than it is going to be to 10, and I think it was a very important call. I also spoke with the King of Saudi Arabia, and that was a very important call. The bottom nine is OPEC+. It’s called OPEC+ because there are other states, also other nations. We came to a very good agreement. Please. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:42:07)
I would say mostly we were talking about China. We were talking about their borders, and we were talking about our borders a little bit, our borders with Mexico, because as you know, Mexico was a big part of the deal. Mexico, really, it was very complex from the standpoint of Mexico. It was not an easy deal for Mexico and the president. We appreciated a certain amount of flexibility, but we talked about borders, we talked about China, talked about Mexico.
--
Donald Trump: (01:42:32)
Well, we did talk about the arms. Yes, we did. That was a very important part of the call actually. Yeah, good point.
--
Donald Trump: (01:42:50)
Well, they have to get the materials. The governors have to get the material. Now, if they can’t get it, they’re going to see us.
--
Donald Trump: (01:42:56)
I’m talking about the local government. I’m talking about governors have to get the material. Now, they have machines. In fact, we were going to go into it. Why don’t you ask Mike, to go into it as soon as I leave? They have very powerful machines that they don’t know they even have. I’m not talking about Abbott, I’m talking about the governors. They have machines that are used for this. You know what I’m referring to?
--
Donald Trump: (01:43:15)
Very big, very powerful machines where in a certain state’s case, they’re only using 10% of their capacity and they didn’t know it. That happens to be Illinois.
--
Donald Trump: (01:43:36)
What do you think the answer to that is?
--
Donald Trump: (01:43:40)
Rapidly increasing the numbers.
--
Donald Trump: (01:43:41)
Rapidly increases. Well, pretty quickly. Yeah?
--
Donald Trump: (01:43:45)
Well, you have other machines where they can really work. A lot of the states have the big machines that can do a lot. They didn’t even know they had them. They didn’t even know that they had them, and Mike is going to be talking about that.
--
Donald Trump: (01:44:04)
Google and Apple.
--
Donald Trump: (01:44:08)
A lot of people don’t like it from the standpoint of constitutional rights. A lot of people don’t like it, and some people think it’s great. No, they are working on that as I understand.
--
Donald Trump: (01:44:24)
No, Google’s looking at it, but Google is also working with Apple, who are looking at something. We have the greatest companies in the world looking at things that, in a year from now, everything that we’re looking at now is going to be obsolete. That’s how good it is. We have things happening that are unbelievable. I saw a presentation today that I can’t talk about yet, but it’s incredible. Plus, I think they’re doing … Tony, I think they’re doing very well in the vaccines. They’re working hard on the vaccines, and I think you’ll have an answer for vaccines. I believe that there’s some great things coming out with respect to that. Now, you need a testing period, but you’re going to have some great things. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:45:04)
No, this is the Google and Apple. I don’t know if it’s a partnership or what, but they’re working on some-
--
Donald Trump: (01:45:09)
They’re working on more than one element. They’re working on a couple of different things, Google and Apple. Google is also working on something as you know, having to do with testing. I believe they’re doing that in a singular fashion.
--
Donald Trump: (01:45:36)
Well, it’s an amazing thing, but a lot of people have some very big constitutional problems with it. You know that. It’s an amazing thing, and would be actually, as you know, other countries are thinking about using something similar, but not as good.
--
Donald Trump: (01:45:51)
I hear Singapore is. Singapore had a little bit of a setback, because they had a break. You know that, but they’ll take care of it. I know the folks in Singapore, they’re doing a great job, and they’re going to put it back very quickly, but Singapore and other countries are looking at other things, and some countries are doing other things.
--
Donald Trump: (01:46:11)
Well, I don’t want to get into that, because we have a whole constitutional thing. We have more of a constitutional problem than a mechanical problem, but we will be making a determination on that. That’s something we’re going to be discussing with a lot of people over the next four weeks. That would be a very accurate way of doing it, but a lot of people have a problem with it. Yeah, please. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:46:37)
It’s moving along. I think I can answer it, because I have to leave. Moving along quickly, moving along well .it’s a test that’s been going along for many, many years, except now we have very modern, very incredible versions of it, but that’s moving on. The antibody test, moving along very well. Okay, any more COVID-19? COVID-19?
--
Donald Trump: (01:47:02)
Well, that’s going through the Navy as I understand it. The Navy is going to be making decisions on all of that, and they had a break in. I don’t think the ship should have been stopping in Vietnam when you have a pandemic to be honest with you. I don’t think the captain should have been writing letters. He’s not Ernest Hemingway, as I said before, and he shouldn’t have been writing letters. I don’t know who gave the orders to stop in Vietnam, but they stopped in Vietnam, and all of a sudden they get on and now you have over 500 sailors and people on the ship that are affected. I don’t know whose idea that was, but that wasn’t such a good idea in the middle of a pandemic. Yes, please?.
--
Donald Trump: (01:47:46)
Nothing changed it. I know exactly what you’re going to say. Nothing changed it. The fact that I want to rely on states, or maybe will or have, and the fact that we’ve gotten on, that’s one thing. The fact that I don’t want to use the power is another thing. Look-
--
Donald Trump: (01:48:02)
Yes, the constitution.
--
Donald Trump: (01:48:05)
You can look at it constitutionally, you could look at federalism. You can look at it any different way. John, the fact that I don’t want to exert my power is much different. We have the power. You asked does the federal government has the power? The federal government has absolute power. It has the power as to whether or not I’ll use that power. We’ll see.
--
Donald Trump: (01:48:24)
John, I would rather work with the states, because I like going down to a local government. That’s why, with I guess it’s now seven states, not eight, because South Carolina did. They went away from what we discussed the last time, so that’s why I looked at the individual states. They’re doing a very good job. They’re really doing a very good job. I’d rather have them make the decision. Now, the fact that I’d rather have, that’s fine, but I have the absolute right to do if I want to. I may not want to. We have a very good relationship now. We’ll see what happens. If you notice the few states you’re talking about, they’re all with democrat governors, but if governors are doing a good job and they control it better, because you don’t have somebody in Washington saying, “Set up a testing site in the parking lot of a Walmart.” We’re in Washington, and they’re in a state that’s very far away.
--
Donald Trump: (01:49:15)
That’s really, it should be, and it should have always been. I’ve always said it was, but the relationship we have now with the states and governors is very good, and we’ll be announcing over the next very short period of time exactly what we’re going to be doing. Okay, a couple more. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:49:41)
Well, nobody’s called about what about coronavirus from their standpoint. Look, they had the H1N1, and that was a big failure. That was a tremendous failure. They had a lot of failures. You take a look at the history, and 17,000 people died, and you talk about late. They were so late, they were late like it never even existed. That was a big problem. It caused a lot of other people a big problem too. If Joe Biden would like a briefing, I’d certainly get him a briefing. I don’t know what he’d do with it. Yeah, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:50:27)
No.
--
Donald Trump: (01:50:28)
No, they’re not. Yes, go ahead, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:50:40)
Well, you have Mike’s task force, which is the White House task force, which really brought us up to this point brilliantly, I must say. Dealt with governors and dealt with governors all the way through. I was on many of those calls, and every call got better and better and better. It was hostile at the beginning. By the time we finished, today’s call was a very good call, very friendly call. I think everyone’s online, and again, you don’t have anybody driving you crazy saying they’re not getting ventilators and not getting all of the different things, they need more beds. They have a lot of beds right now. We always are, and I think it’s important.
--
Donald Trump: (01:51:16)
We always erred on the sake of give them more, even when we didn’t think … We didn’t think New York needed the beds that they were asking for. We didn’t think they needed the ventilators that they asked for, and they were right. Now, on ventilators, we’re ready to march. I told you this. We’re ready to march. We have 10,000 ventilators. We’re ready to move them anywhere in the country where we need them, if we need them. We’re also building lot of ventilators, and that’s going to be used at some point, I believe. We’re going to have stockpiles including state stockpiles if they want to work out some kind of an arrangement with us, but we’re also going to help other countries, whether it’s Italy or Spain or other. France is having a big problem. They all desperately need. Germany too. They need ventilators, so we’re going to have a lot of ventilators. We have a lot. You heard the numbers. We have a lot coming next week. Next week, we have a tremendous amount coming. Okay, final question.
--
Donald Trump: (01:52:09)
No, but then we have, in addition to that, we have a number of committees. We’ll have a transportation committee. We’re going to have a manufacturing committee. You’ll see it tomorrow. We’re also having a religious leaders committee. We have a great group of religious leaders. We’re having committees with religious leaders. You’ve been seeing what’s going on at the churches and all of that, and we’re going to have a faith leaders committee. We’re going to have a few committees. I’ll call them committees, and then ultimately we’re going to make decisions. We’re going to make decisions fairly quickly, and I think they’re going to need to be the correct decision. I hope so. Steve?
--
Donald Trump: (01:52:51)
Soon, and they already know what I want. When we form, when you say form, I don’t have to give them instructions. These are very sophisticated people. These are the best people in their fields, so I’d have to say, “Gee, we just met, and we’re going to meet in two weeks, and here’s what we’re …” I said, “Here’s what I want. We’ve already told them, and they’re the best names in the various businesses and professions and religions. These are the greatest names, the people that I think probably know the best, so we’ve called them and we’re going to be speaking to them very soon. If it’s questions or statements, we want them to have that for us, and we will have either response. Or maybe, ideally we’re going to be learning from them, and we’ll be able to do that and put everything we learn from those calls into our new guidelines. We’re going to have new guidelines coming soon. I think it’s going to be very good. I think it’s going to be very smooth, and I hope it’s going to be very safe. Thank you all very much.
--
Donald Trump: (01:53:51)
Stanley Chera is a friend of mine for a long time. He’s a great real estate person, passed away. Was a great real estate person. Great, great. Sort of a legend in New York real estate. He called me a couple of weeks ago, said he’s tested positive. Stanley’s in his early to mid-80s I guess, and Stanley went to the hospital, and he never came out. He went into a coma. He was unconscious for a long period of time, and he never made it. A great man. He left very charitable, really a great philanthropist, a very, very successful person in Manhattan, in the real estate business. I got to know him a lot.
--
Donald Trump: (01:54:39)
He was so excited when his friend from New York became the President of the United States. He was like a young boy, and he was not a young boy, but he was like a young boy. He was so excited. He thought I would do such a good job, and he was so happy. He was very proud of what we’ve done in this administration, but he was tested positive, and unfortunately he didn’t make it. To me, it’s a very sad thing. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thanks, doctor. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (02:30)
Thank you. Thank you very much. I just had a great conversation with the leading faith leaders of our country. It went extremely well. We learned a lot. I learned a lot, and we’re working on some things that are very interesting, and very positive. I thank them all for being on the call. And yesterday, we unveiled detailed guidelines for America’s governors to initiate a phased, safe, and gradual reopening of America. That’s what’s happening. The guidelines provide governors with the fact-driven and science-based metrics they will need to make the decisions that are right for their own particular state. To view the guidelines, you can go to the website at Whitehouse.gov/OpeningAmerica. So that’s Whitehouse.gov/OpeningAmerica. Treasury has sent out economic relief payments to more than 80 million Americans who have their direct deposit information on file with the IRS. And an incredible success it has been. If you have not received your check, please visit IRS.gov/GetMyPayment. How about that one? IRS.gov/GetMyPayment. That way the IRS can get you your payment in days, and they’ve done a fantastic job, I have to say. And you won’t have to wait for a check in the mail.
--
Donald Trump: (03:58)
I have some very good news. We sent out 80 million deposits, and less than 1% had even little problems. A couple of had minor glitches, but it’s substantially less than 1%. so out of 80 million deposits, less than 1%, and that gets corrected immediately. So just please do as they say, you’ll get that very quickly, very easily. Today I’m also announcing that Secretary Perdue, who happens to be right next to me, handsome man, and the Department of Agriculture will be implementing a $19 billion relief program for our great farmers, and ranchers as they cope with the fallout of the global pandemic. Very honored to be doing this. Our farmers, ranchers, these are great people, great Americans. Never complain, they never complain. They just do what they have to do. The program will include direct payments to farmers, as well as mass purchases of dairy, meat and agricultural produce to get that food to the people in need. The USDA will receive another $14 billion in July that will have funding to continue help or helping. And this will help our farmers, and our ranches, and it’s money well deserved.
--
Donald Trump: (05:23)
So not only were they targeted at one point by China, and that was over a period of time, and you saw that happening, and they never complained, but that worked out very well. $12 billion they got, and $16 billion they got. And now it’s 19 billion. And I’m just going to ask Secretary Perdue to explain exactly how we’re going to handle it. Thank you.
--
Donald Trump: (09:09)
Thank you very much, thank you very much. Thank you Sonny. So our great secretary of agriculture was the governor of Georgia for eight years. And the only reason he isn’t still there, frankly, is that he was term-limited. And I said, let’s get him for agriculture, and you’ve done a fantastic job. We want to thank you very much. Eight years at Georgia. We really appreciate it. Great job. Even as we prepare to rebuild our economy, America continues to wage a all-out medical war to defeat the invisible enemy. To date, we have conducted more than 3.78 million Coronavirus tests, by far the most of any country. It’s not even close. In the hardest hit areas such as New York and Louisiana, we’ve also tested more people per capita than South Korea, Singapore, and every other country. The United States has the most robust, advanced, and accurate testing system anywhere in the world. As of yesterday, we have distributed nearly 660,000 Abbott IDs. Now that’s an incredible test. It’s called the ID Now point of care diagnostic test, and it’s fantastic. It’s the hot one. Problem with this business is it’s the hot one until about two days from now. Because we do have a saliva test that just came out, and that can be self-administered, and it’s said to be fantastic. I want to thank Abbott Laboratories. They have been incredible. I want to thank Roche. They’ve likewise been incredible. Over the last several days, we’ve seen a dramatic increase in the number of tests conducted by hospitals and academic institutions, which have now performed nearly 600,000 tests. There’s a tremendous amount of unused capacity in the states available for governors to tap. We have tremendous unused capability within those laboratories, and I hope the governors are going to be able to use them. The governors are responsible for testing, and I hope they’re going to be able to use this tremendous amount of available capacity that we have. It’s up to one million additional tests per week.
--
Donald Trump: (11:28)
When you think of that, in the next few weeks, we’ll be sending out 5.5 million testing swabs to the state. Swabs can be done easily by the governors themselves. Mostly it’s cotton. It’s not a big deal. You can get cotton easily, but if they can’t get it, we will take care of it. Yesterday the FDA announced a new collaboration with United Health Group, the Gates Foundation, Quantagen, and US Cotton to greatly expand the supply of essential swabs, including a new polyester Q-tip-type swab for the Coronavirus testing. All of these actions will help our testing capability continue to grow dramatically. So we’re helping people. Even with swabs, we get ventilators. We’re now the the king of ventilators. We have hundreds of thousands under construction. We don’t need them ourselves. The governors are in great shape. If we do, we have a great stockpile that we’ll immediately send to the state in need, but we’ve handled that situation incredibly well. I hope people understand it.
--
Donald Trump: (12:37)
I wish the media would get the word out. What we’ve done in ventilators is amazing, because they’re big, expensive, and highly complex. We’re speaking to other countries. I spoke to President of Mexico today, great gentlemen, and I told him that we are going to be helping him out with ventilators, helping Mexico out. And we’ll be helping some other countries too. We have a lot of very high-level, high quality ventilators, and they’re here, and they’re also being manufactured as we speak. Following the announcement of our re-opening guidelines, there have been some very partisan voices in the media and politics who have spread false and misleading information about our testing capacity. It’s totally false and misleading. Demonstrating a complete failure to understand the enormous scope of the testing capabilities that we’ve brought online. And we started really from ground zero. We started from really being very, very outdated and obsolete, as a country, from the past, and I will say this, if they didn’t understand it, it’s just really, unfortunately, I hate to say this, because we’ve been getting along very well, but it would be false reporting, because they understand the capability.
--
Donald Trump: (13:53)
And it’s going to be up to the states to use that capability. The states have local points where they can go. A governor can call the mayors, and the mayors can call representatives, and everything is perfect. And that’s the way it should work, and always should work. We’ll help New York and all of the other states get even better on their testing. We have to get even better, and some people think a little bit differently. There are areas where you have vast amounts of area where you have very few people, and almost no people are infected. And those places will be looked upon differently by different governors, and I think you’re going to have a lot of news coming out about that over the next few days. I think certain states are going to come online, and they’re going to start the early stages of the puzzle that we’re putting together, and it’s going to be together sooner rather than later.
--
Donald Trump: (14:48)
A lot of really incredible things are happening. And at some point in the not too distant future, we’re going to have our country back, and it’s going to be, I think really with what we’re doing on stimulus and helping people keep their businesses together, and their lives together, and their jobs. It’s going to be better than ever before. I hope so. I really do. The current conversation is reminiscent of what happened on ventilators. You remember that. When requests were made, far beyond what was objectively needed, we were hearing from a certain state, and we were hearing from a lot that they needed far more ventilators. In one case they wanted 40,000 ventilators, 40,000. It turned out that they had plenty, and they had a number of about seven or 8,000, and that was plenty. We supplied them with a lot, but that was the right number. We got it just about right. And if they did need more, we’re ready to give more. But I think the surge seems to be over, and there are a lot of governors just doing a great job. And they’re working with us, but we’re all working together.
--
Donald Trump: (15:58)
The research and development that we’ve done at the federal level has been absolutely incredible. The media will be accepting of these figures when they get to see the end result. I think they’re going to see it, and I think they’re already seeing it. That includes not only ventilators, but beds. We built, in most cases, far more than they even needed. But we wanted to err on the side of caution. This is what the governors wanted. They wanted a certain amount in Louisiana. I spoke with the governor, had a long talk with him, and I said, “Do you think you’ll need that final hospital?” And they actually didn’t need it. We built a lot of beds, so I appreciate it from the governor. And we saved building a hospital in New York. We did, I think just a spectacular job at the Javits Center, and even sending the ship up became, we brought it into COVID, but they didn’t really need, it. It didn’t get much use, but it was there and ready.
--
Donald Trump: (16:59)
It wasn’t supposed to be used for that purpose. We changed it into that purpose, and it was there, ready, willing and able. Same with Javits, but they didn’t quite need the beds that we produced. So we produced almost 2,900 beds. And I think I’d rather tell you that we were over-prepared than we were under-prepared. And that was a good faith effort by New York. I have to say that. A very good faith effort, but it’s nice that we didn’t need that instead of needing it. It was not very occupied. But it was ready to go. It’s still there should something happen, but I think they have it under very good control. As you’ll hear from our experts today, we’ve already built sufficient testing capacity nationwide for states to begin their reopenings, and I think you’ll be hearing a lot about reopenings in the coming weeks and months. Most excitingly in the coming weeks, I think you’re going to see some very, very dramatic steps taken, and very safely. We’re putting safety first. We may be opening, but we’re putting safety first.
--
Donald Trump: (18:11)
And when you look at the numbers, when you look at the possible number of deaths at 2.2 million people, and it could have very well been that. It could have been more. Frankly, I’ve been looking at numbers where it could have been higher than that. 2.2 million people dying. If you figure we lost 500, 000, maybe 600,000 in the Civil War, 2.2 million people, a minimum, if we did nothing would have been 1.6. If you cut that in half, you’re talking about 800,000, 900,000, a million people dying, but we did a lot of work, and the people of this country were incredible, I have to say. And I think we’re heading to the other category. And that would be if we did work, and if it was successful, they had between 100,000 and 220,000, to 240, 000 on the upside. And I think we’ll be substantially hopefully below the hundred number. And I think right now we’re heading it probably around 60, maybe 65,000. And one is too many. I always say it, one is too many. This is a horrible thing that happened to our country.
--
Donald Trump: (19:19)
This is a horrible thing that happened to 184 countries, all over the world, it’s a horrible thing and there was no reason for it. It should never ever happen again. In a few minutes, you will be hearing from Dr. Redfield, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Burks, and Admiral Giroir to explain these facts in really great detail. Earlier this week, the FDA authorized two new antibody tests, which is very exciting, that will determine if someone has been previously infected with the virus, bringing the total to four authorized antibody tests already. This will help us assess the number of cases that have been asymptomatic, or mildly symptomatic. And support our efforts to get Americans back to work by showing us who might have developed the wonderful, beautiful immunity. Ultimate victory in this war will be made possible by America’s scientific brilliance. There is nothing like us. There is nobody like us, not even close. I wish I could tell you stories what other countries, even powerful countries say to me, the leaders, and they say it quietly, and they say it off the record, but they have great respect for what we can do.
--
Donald Trump: (20:35)
And our country is at a point, a few weeks ago, think of it, four or five weeks ago, we were at a level that nobody had ever attained, the best job numbers we’ve ever had, the best economy we’ve ever had. Every company virtually was doing better business than ever before. The stock market was at all time highs, and then one day they said, you got to close it up, and we did the right thing. We saved maybe millions of lives by doing it the way we did it, but we’re paying a price, but that price is very unimportant compared to the number of lives we’re talking about. The NIH and others are conducting clinical trials of 35 different therapies and treatments. Therapies being so exciting to me, because that’s really like if something happens, you’re going to get better, reasonably quickly, and without such a horrible deal as some people have to go through. To that end today, NIH announced that it is launching a public-private partnership with more than a dozen biopharmaceutical companies, their HHS, FDA, CDC and the European Medicines agency. They’re all working together.
--
Donald Trump: (21:52)
We’re working together with a lot of other countries. The partnership will marshal and coordinate the vast resources, knowledge, assets and authorities of more than a dozen organizations and agencies to accelerate development of the most promising therapies and vaccines. The vaccines are coming along really, really well. Johnson and Johnson is very well advanced, and one thing is, we’re having great, great success, but we have to test them, and it takes a long period of time. It takes probably over a year, unfortunately, but therapy’s likewise are coming along very, very well. Therapies are immediate. When we get that, that’ll be a big day. We’re also equipping our medical warriors on the front lines. In total, we have the Project Airbridge, and the Airbridge has been incredible. The National Strategic Stockpile, and every other channel the federal government has deployed. If you think about this, 44.5 million N95 masks, nearly 524 million gloves, 63.5 million surgical masks, and more than 10 million gowns, and we have 500 million masks coming in very soon, between manufacturing and orders. 500 million masks. The last few months have been among the most challenging times in the history of our nation.
--
Donald Trump: (23:21)
This invisible enemy is tough, and it’s smart, and it’s vicious, but every day we’re getting closer to the future that we all had been waiting for. I talk about the light at the end of the tunnel. We are getting very, very close to seeing that light shine very brightly at the end of that tunnel. And it’s happening, and I want to thank everybody in the room. I actually want to thank some of the media. We’ve had some fair coverage, some really fair coverage, and I appreciate it. What I’m going to do is I’m going to introduce our great Vice President, Mike Pence, and he’s going to take over for a little while. I’m going to leave, and I’m coming right back, and we’ll take some questions. They’re going to go over our tremendous testing capabilities, and again, I’ll be right back. Thank you. Thank you very much.
--
Donald Trump: (01:14:38)
He did well, they all did well I think. I’ll bet they did. Please, go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:14:50)
Who said this?
--
Donald Trump: (01:15:06)
Well, I think we do have a sobering guidance, but I think some things are too tough. And if you look at some of the states you just mentioned, it’s too tough. Not only relative to this, but what they’ve done in Virginia with respect to the second amendment is just a horrible thing. They did a horrible thing, the governor, and he’s a governor under a cloud to start off with. So, when you see what he said about the second amendment, when you see what other states have done. No, I think I feel very comfortable. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:15:43)
No, but I think elements of what they’ve done are too much. It’s just too much. You know the elements because I’ve already said, but certainly a second amendment and second amendment having to do with the state of Virginia. What they’ve done in Virginia is just incredible. Okay, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:16:12)
These are people expressing their views. I see where they are and I see the way they’re working. They seem to be very responsible people to me, but they’ve been treated a little bit rough. Please, in the back.
--
Donald Trump: (01:16:52)
Well, we’re seeing great numbers in almost every state. We’re seeing big drops. We’re really seeing in terms of beds, the numbers we have to look at are the beds, the beds being occupied, which is essentially people going in. That means that you have fewer people that are sick, fewer people that feel they have to go to a hospital and those numbers are dropping really precipitously. So, I think that we’re just seeing a lot of good signs. Now, a place like New York, New Jersey, and certain parts of Louisiana. Louisiana has been incredible lately when you look at that drop, that drop has really been great. Michigan’s had a hard time, but it’s starting to do well, so I just think Illinois is another one. You look at some of the numbers but everyone is dropping and they’re dropping rather quickly. We don’t have any hotspot that’s developed, other than we did have a meatpacking plant or two where incredibly you saw the number was rather incredible that took place in that plant. People could ask about that. I wonder who owned that company. It was a weird situation, but generally speaking it’s been very good. The numbers have been really improving greatly. Please, in the back.
--
Donald Trump: (01:18:28)
The Obama administration gave them a grant of $3.7 million, I’ve been hearing about that. And we’ve instructed that if any grants are going to that area, we’re looking at it literally about an hour ago and also early in the morning. We will end that grant very quickly, but it was granted quite a while ago. They were granted a substantial amount of money. We’re going to look at it and take a look, but I understand it was a number of years ago, right?
--
Donald Trump: (01:18:58)
What did you hear the grant was made?
--
Donald Trump: (01:19:01)
2015? Who was president then, I wonder? Okay. Yes, ma’am?
--
Donald Trump: (01:19:19)
Well, I think it will certainly… It’s going to get us to a point that’s going to be rather beautiful. We think that that will be the point and it could be they want more, but maybe at a certain point we’re going to stop. It’s been a tremendous success. It’s been executed flawlessly. SBA has done a very good job, but the banks have done a great job. Whether it was Bank of America or Wells Fargo. The community banks have been incredible. I think we had over 4,000 community banks. A lot of people didn’t know you had that many banks, but 4,000 community banks, they gave the money out. It’s so organized and it’s been such a great program and so essentially, we’re waiting for $250 billion. The Democrats are refusing to do it. This is money that essentially is going to the workers. It’s going to keep these companies whole. Restaurants and a lot of great companies, and it’s a small amount of money relative to what it represents because it represents small businesses. It represents them staying in business. And when you look at it, people don’t know, small businesses represent approximately 50% of the power of our business enterprises. Not all the big monster businesses that you read about every day. It’s all of these small businesses when added. It’s something that should be approved by the Democrats, the Republicans want it badly and the people want it very badly.
--
Donald Trump: (01:20:42)
Sure.
--
Donald Trump: (01:20:50)
No, they would get that, but they have to approve an… Nobody knew it was going to be the successful. Don’t forget, when you say the money’s gone, it’s been a tremendous success as a program. People, they really want it and some people won’t be able to keep their-
--
Donald Trump: (01:21:03)
People, they really want it, and some people won’t be able to keep their business open unless they get that money. It’s been a tremendous success. It’s been executed flawlessly. It’s been… I mean, with few exceptions, it’s really been good, and I think the Democrats are going to do it. Look, Nancy Pelosi, she’s away on vacation or something, and she should come back. She should come back and get this done. I don’t know why she’s not coming back. The fact is, she’s not doing her job and there’s nothing unusual about that for her. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:21:32)
So they are thinking about hospitals, and hospitals… [crosstalk 01:21:36] Well, hospitals are a good thing. Hospitals have been decimated by this. They’ve given up their business, which is good because they did the right thing in order to take care of the COVID-19, and no, hospitals, I’m with that all the way. If they want to add hospitals, we could also add it into phase four if we do a phase four. Phase four would be hopefully infrastructure. A lot of people are talking about the best thing we could do for this country would be the payroll tax cut that I’ve been suggesting. A lot of Democrats like it, believe it or not.
--
Donald Trump: (01:22:09)
The payroll tax cut. And Art Laffer who’s tremendous… He’s a tremendous… In fact, he recently got the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Economist. He was with Ronald Reagan, and he’s been… He looks like he’s 25 years old, but I think you might be a little bit older than that. He looks so great. But Art Laffer said the single best thing you can do is the payroll tax cut, and I would just about agree with that, and I’d like to see that. I’m not sure that we’re going to get that, but I think that’s something that could be done. It’s simple. It’s really good for both the company that employs these people and for the people that are employed.
--
Donald Trump: (01:22:45)
So we’re going to see whether that happens or not. The payroll… I put it out there, the payroll tax cut would be a tremendous incentive for this country. Steve?
--
Donald Trump: (01:23:04)
Well, you know, when I listen to the press every night saying we have the most… We don’t have the most in the world deaths. The most in the world has to be China. It’s a massive country. It’s gone through a tremendous problem with this, a tremendous problem, and they must have the most. So today I saw they announced that essentially they’re doubling up on the numbers, and that’s only in Wuhan . They’re not talking about outside of Wuhan. So it is what it is Steve. It is what it is. What a sad state of affairs.
--
Donald Trump: (01:23:42)
Well, we’re looking at it. A lot of people are looking at it. It seems to make sense. They talk about a certain kind of bat, but that bat wasn’t in that area, if you can believe this. That’s what they’re down to now is bats. But that bat is not in that area. That bat wasn’t sold at that wet zone. It wasn’t sold there. That bat is 40 miles away, so a lot of strange things are happening, but there is a lot of investigation going on, and we’re going to find out. All I can say is wherever it came from… It came from China. In whatever form, 184 countries now are suffering because of it, and it’s too bad, isn’t it? And it could have been solved very easily when it was just starting.
--
Donald Trump: (01:24:26)
It could have been solved really very easily. Yeah, please, in the back.
--
Donald Trump: (01:24:43)
Well I’m just saying, it’s less than one percent, and the snafus are very minor.
--
Donald Trump: (01:24:52)
No, they were 80 million payments, went out over a period of a few days, and they caught certain mistakes that they made, but this is a tiny amount of mistakes. I can tell you, mistakes are made in government where wrong countries were signed. Okay? 80 million… This has been a tremendous success, and any mistake that was made, they’ve been caught, and it’s less than one percent. That’s a very good percentage, I can tell you for government. I mean, how about the Obama website, The Obamacare website, where they spent five billion dollars on building a website that you could have built for peanuts? Okay.
--
Donald Trump: (01:25:33)
Yeah. Anything that was sent out… It’s like sometimes you send a check to somebody wrong. Sometimes people are listed. They die, and they get a check. That can happen. You’re talking about… I guess the number is about 80 million people. Yeah, sure. We’ll get that back. Everything we’re going to get back, but it’s a tiny amount. They’ve done a fantastic job. This was done in a matter of a few days. Yeah.
--
Donald Trump: (01:26:06)
Well, I hope we can do rallies. It’s great for the country. It’s great spirit. It’s great for a lot of things. To me, it’s a tremendous way of getting the word out. If you look at our success rate, we’ve had tremendous success. We win where we have rallies, including endorsements of candidates. Our success rate is I think unparalleled. There’s nothing like it. So I certainly hope we can have rallies. We’ll find out. I don’t like the rallies where we’re sitting like you’re sitting. I mean, you’ve got many reporters outside trying to get into this room, and I come in, I’m looking at this room, and I see all this. It loses a lot of flavor. It loses to me, a lot of flavor, but I hope we’re going to have rallies. I think they’re going to be bigger than ever.
--
Donald Trump: (01:26:47)
I will say this. The rallies that we were having until we had to stop with regard to the problem that we had here, the rallies were bigger than they were… I think even substantially bigger. We’d go into the biggest arena, and we’d turn away 20, 30 thousand people sometimes, and in one case, I think they said in New Jersey we had 175,000 people show up for an arena that holds 9,000 people. And they showed up. And the reporters even reported that. That was almost shocking to me. But I hope we can resume rallies, because I think they’re an important part of politics actually.
--
Donald Trump: (01:27:35)
Well, I think the businesses are going to, and I think now we’ve given the businesses a real jolt, a real positive jolt. They’re able to keep their employees… Without the employees, if the employees leave that area, if they leave, who knows where they’re going? Or if they get another job maybe someplace else, you’re not going to have the same business. So we gave them money to hold their employees. They’re going to do that. We hope we can do $250 billion more. It’s absolutely so inexpensive compared to what it represents, and we hope that’s going to happen, but I think… I really think… Look, you see it with the stock market. T
--
Donald Trump: (01:28:10)
he market was up seven or eight hundred points today, and if you would have told me that we would have a virus the likes of which this world has not seen since 1917, which was the Spanish flu, where anywhere from 75 to 100 million people were killed, and that we’d have a stock market that’s not far below its all time high… And it’s starting to get a little low. You know, then you had a thousand point increase and a 1,200 point increase. So now, we have a stock market that’s at a point where it’s not very far away from where it was, and we’ve gone through literally a closed country. Remember this also. I mean, we have had a closed economy.
--
Donald Trump: (01:29:00)
We had the best economy anywhere in the world by far. We had the best economy we’ve ever had. And remember this, the dollar is very strong, and dollars, strong dollars are overall very good, but it does cause problems. It’s harder to sell outside of the country, et cetera, et cetera. It’s a little harder for manufacturers. Sometimes it’s a lot harder. Everybody wants to invest in our country. Everybody wants… And you know, we’re paying almost zero in interest, in some cases, zero. We’ve never had that before. People want the safety of our country.
--
Donald Trump: (01:29:31)
But if you would’ve told me that our market was where it is today, and today we had almost I guess more than a 700 point increase, and we’re at a point which is… It’s not what it was, but it’s not that far off. I would have told you that’s got to be an impossibility. The reason that is, is because there is a great pent up demand. This country’s going to come back and it’s going to come back strong. We have to get rid of the virus. We’ve got to open up our country. We’re going to open it up in quadrants. We’re going to open it up as states. Some of the states should get together, and they should work on their own borders and everything because you don’t want to have people pouring through a border of a state that isn’t infected, and you have people coming perhaps outside.
--
Donald Trump: (01:30:11)
That’s one of the reasons I was asking Tony two days ago about masks. Well, why in Wyoming or Montana would they have to wear masks, their numbers are very good? The reason, if somebody comes from outside, which is very severe, but it’s again… And it’s going to be up to them. It’s a recommendation, but we’ll see. But if you would’ve told me how well we’re doing after we went through the worst event of its kind since 1917, it’s pretty amazing. Question please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:30:52)
The schools will be open too, very soon.
--
Donald Trump: (01:30:59)
Yeah. It’s a good question. I think the schools are going to be open soon. I think a lot of governors are already talking about schools being opened, and we do have to take care of our seniors, because we’ve learned a lot about this disease. We’ve learned… Call it a disease. We’ve learned a lot about this plague, and we have to take care of our seniors. We’re going to take care of a lot of people, but I think the schools are going to be open sooner rather than later. And I understand, and I’ve spoken… Some governors are already talking about thinking about getting the schools open. I have a young boy who goes to school. I’d like to see him go to school.
--
Donald Trump: (01:31:29)
As good as home is, it’s very nice, but we’d like to see him go to school. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:31:48)
Well, they’re going to have soon, but they’re very very very… What they’ve done is very powerful in terms of… You could get the same result out of doing a little bit less. What they’ve done to some people is very unfair. In Virginia, I’m going above and beyond what we’re talking about with this horrible plague. They want to take their guns away. Okay? They want to take their guns away. That’s the second amendment. That’s Virginia. You have a governor who really… I guess he should be under siege. He seems not to be. If he were a Republican, he’d be under siege, but he seems to have escaped something that was pretty bad, including what he said about birth, including what he said about many different things.
--
Donald Trump: (01:32:32)
But he wants to take… If you take a look at what’s going on in Virginia, they want to take away second amendment rights, and that’s what they want to do. So when you talk about liberate or if you talk about a liberation, you could certainly look at Virginia as one. Go ahead. Anybody else?
--
Donald Trump: (01:32:52)
Well, I don’t want to go. I want to leave it to the governors to make that decision. We’re watching very closely. If we see something happening bad that we think is wrong, we’re going to come down very strong on that, very very strong. The federal government has a lot to say. We have a lot to say beyond what anyone understands, and we think, and I’ve gotten to know many of the governors, many Democrats too. It’s Republicans, and I knew the Republicans. I knew some of the Democrats, but I got to know a lot of them. I think it’s going to be in the hands of a lot of good people.
--
Donald Trump: (01:33:25)
I think a lot of good people are looking at this, and they want to do what’s right Steve.
--
Donald Trump: (01:33:35)
Well, they’d rather not have me travel. I think I’ve been in the White House, I don’t know, for months. I don’t know what it is, but it’s for months. Other than I did leave to say goodbye to our beautiful ship. Right? The Comfort, as it left Virginia, when it got out of dry dock. It got out of maintenance very early. It was supposed to be there for four weeks. It was there for a few days. Literally, we got it up to New York. I mean, they didn’t need it like… Well, I wouldn’t say we hoped. I’m glad they didn’t need it. They didn’t need it. That was a good thing. They didn’t need the convention center, 2,500 beds, or depending on your definition, 2,900.
--
Donald Trump: (01:34:13)
We ultimately converted it to COVID. The Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA, the job they did was incredible, but that’s a sign that they’re making progress in New York. If you look at that, we built it, it was ready. It’s there now. It’s ready. We converted it to COVID. It wasn’t supposed to be for that, at the request of frankly our side. Then ultimately, we converted it, but there is much less demand. That’s such a good thing. I mean, I’m not complaining about that. I think it’s a great… That means New York’s making progress.
--
Donald Trump: (01:34:47)
He’s going to Colorado? I think he’s going to the Air Force to make the commencement, correct?
--
Donald Trump: (01:34:54)
Oh, I think it’s great. I think it’s great. If he’s going to make the commencement… I hear they’re going to have a very spread out crowd.
--
Donald Trump: (01:35:01)
They are going to be a… I will say, they are going to be socially very good. They’re going to be very far apart. That’ll be very interesting. I think I’m going to watch that one. No, they’re going to be… They’re going to have a good spread, a good distance apart. I spoke to Mike about it. No, I think making the commencement speech, I’m doing it at West Point, which I look forward to. I did it last year at Air Force, I did it at Annapolis, I did it at the Coast Guard Academy, and I’m doing it at West Point, and I assume they’ve got it, and I understand they’ll have distancing. They’ll have some big distances.
--
Donald Trump: (01:35:39)
So it’ll be very different than it ever looked. Do I like the look? No, I don’t. And eventually, next year they’ll have a commencement which will be like it’s been, like when people like this, our great admiral has done such a great job… When he graduated from where he graduated… Me too. We’re nice and tight. And that’s going to happen again. I don’t want people to think that this is going to be like this forever, but for a period of time, we’re going to have to keep it that way. That includes baseball games and football games and other things, but eventually as this virus goes away, it’s going to be better and better.
--
Donald Trump: (01:36:16)
Director, it’s going to be better and better, and we’re going to get our lives back to the way they were. You know, one thing that bothers me, a couple of restaurateurs called, and they said, “Sir, I barely made a living with 150 seats. Now if I do what they want me to do, I’ll be down to 25 seats, and I can’t.” I said, “Yeah, but you’re not going to be there forever.” And he didn’t really know that. He thought that they were going to take 150 seats, move it down to 25 to 50 seats, depending on the way he laid it out. I said, “Don’t worry about it. Eventually, you’re going to be back to the scene that you used to have, which was…”
--
Donald Trump: (01:36:51)
Look, I could tell you about… And I’m not going to do it because I didn’t want to bring it up, but I could tell you about events that took place, and I said things like, “You’ll never do that again,” or, “You’ll never do this again.” I don’t even want to mention the events. I don’t want to mention what you’re supposed to be doing because… And you know, one of them was so horrible. I said a certain industry will be out of business, never happen again. Two weeks later it was like nothing ever happened.
--
Donald Trump: (01:37:18)
Hopefully, we get rid of this. We have tremendous talent up here and all over, including governors, including local governments, state governments. I look forward to the time, to me, when we can really normalize. But normalizing is being back to where we were. Yeah, please. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:37:49)
So I just made a deal with China, where they’re going to put in $250 billion of product. They’re going to be buying 250… 50 from 40 to 50 billion in pharm. I want to see what’s happening with China. I want to see how they’re doing on it. Are they fulfilling the deal, the transaction? We have a lot of discussions going on with China. Let me just put it this way. I’m not happy. Okay? I’m not happy, and I spoke to them, and this could have been shut down a long time ago. They knew it, and we couldn’t get in, and in all fairness, World Health couldn’t get in, and that’s why I wish they took a different stance.
--
Donald Trump: (01:38:31)
They took a very pathetic stance and a very weak stance, but they say they couldn’t get in. But ultimately, they got in. They got in much sooner than anybody, but they didn’t report what was happening. They didn’t report what was happening inside of China. No, I’m not happy with China. Yeah, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:39:05)
Want to go?
--
Donald Trump: (01:40:19)
And I will say this, I’m very very satisfied with the decision we made. Listening to experts, listening to my gut, the feeling of the vice president and really many others when we put it all together are very… Look, if we didn’t do what we did at the time, we could have lost more than two million people. I really believe that. I could show you charts of other places that gave it a shot, and they’re not doing well. And I would show it to you right now. I don’t want to embarrass anybody, but they gave that a shot. That’s an automatic. I mean, everybody would say let’s do that until they sit down and start thinking.
--
Donald Trump: (01:40:39)
And we could’ve lost more than two million people. We could have lost more than two million. It could have been much more than that, by the way. We have one that says from 1.6 to 2.2, but it could have really been more than that. But I looked at one in particular, one country in particular that is using the herd mentality and not working out very well. Now, with all of that being said, we have to get back to work. We’ll be crossing lines very soon in many cases. In some cases, we’re well on the way down. In other cases, we’re right at the top and heading down. We’re heading in the right direction.
--
Donald Trump: (01:41:37)
I saw some numbers from New Jersey, which was having a very tough time. It started… He’s doing a terrific job, the governor, Phil. Phil Murphy. Starting to get some really good signs. I looked at some of the New York numbers. They’re starting to get… They’ve been devastated obviously, but some really good things are starting to happen. So if we would’ve done something different… First of all, it would not have been sustainable. You would have had people… They would have been furious at you and me and everybody up here.
--
Donald Trump: (01:42:10)
It would not have been sustainable, because you look at some of the hospitals as an example, a certain hospital right near where I grew up in Queens, and you had body bags all over the floor of that hospital. You know the one I’m talking about. All over the floor of the hospital. Now, multiply that times 12 or 15, because that’s the kind of numbers you’re talking about. 12 or 15. And it would not have been… It would not have been… There would’ve been an insurrection. Nobody would’ve understood that, whereas right now, nobody can be blamed, and there is no blame.
--
Donald Trump: (01:42:48)
We’re all in a situation that was caused, that should’ve been solved long ago. It could have been solved probably very easily. Look, this is a tough enemy, but probably very easily if a certain country did what they should have done. And we’re just starting to learn those facts. But what we did was the right thing. What we did was the right thing. With that being said, we want to get back, and we want to… We’re going to be opening up states.
--
Donald Trump: (01:43:15)
They’re being opened by very capable people. It’s also point of sale as they say in a different business. It’s the point… They’ll be able to look at where the testing is taking place. We’re going to help them with the testing. We’ve developed some tremendous tests over the last little while, and we’re going to work with the states, and we’re going to help them. But they know every inch of land in their states.
--
Donald Trump: (01:43:36)
I watched the governor of Arkansas, Asa. You saw that. I thought he was terrific. I watched to the governor of Oklahoma over the weekend being interviewed. He was terrific. They’ve done it a little bit differently, and they’ve done it tight, and they’ve done it strong, and they were very prepared, and they had more beds than they needed, and that’s a good thing. But I’ve seen some very very good things, and I think you’re going to have some very positive events taking place over a very short period of time.
--
Donald Trump: (01:44:02)
And I think with that, we’ll see you tomorrow. But really this has been… This has been a situation where a lot of great people have been involved, and a lot of great decisions have been made. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:12)
Thank you very much everyone. Thank you.
--
Donald Trump: (01:29)
Following the release of our reopening guidelines, governors across the country are looking forward to phase one and announcing plans for an economic resurgence. We’re going to have a resurgence, too. At a time when millions of American workers and families are struggling with the financial consequences of the virus, it’s critical to continue the medical war while reopening the economy in a safe and responsible fashion.
--
Donald Trump: (01:56)
During this time, Americans must maintain strict vigilance and continue to practice careful hygiene, social distancing, and the other protective measures that we have outlined and that everybody’s become very familiar with. We continue to be encouraged that many of the areas hardest hit by the virus appear to have turned the corner.
--
Donald Trump: (02:16)
For example, recent deaths are down very, very substantially. You can compare that with their peak not so long ago, and you have numbers of 30%, 25% in Detroit, as an example. It’s down by over 50%. Congratulations. And in New Orleans where they’ve done a terrific job, they’re down 65%. 30 states have just one case or less per 1000 people, far fewer cases per capita as an example than Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Ireland, Switzerland, Singapore, Belgium, Spain, Norway, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden.
--
Donald Trump: (02:57)
My administration continues to press Congress to replenish the enormously successful paycheck protection program, which has impacted 30 million American jobs. We hope to have an agreement very soon and hopefully tomorrow the Senate is going to be able to vote. A lot of progress has been made on that, tremendous progress. It’s a great plan. It’s a great plan. It’s helped a lot of people. So we hope to have a vote maybe tomorrow in the Senate.
--
Donald Trump: (03:24)
And based on the record low price of oil that you’ve been seeing, it’s at a level that’s very interesting to a lot of people. We’re filling up our national petroleum reserves, strategic, the strategic reserves, and we’re looking to put as much as 75 million barrels into the reserves themselves. That would top it out. That would be the first time in a long time it’s been topped out. We’d get it for the right price.
--
Donald Trump: (03:55)
We’re also pushing for the deal to include an additional and visits, elective procedures, surgeries, etc, etc, were canceled. We think that they can all get back online and get it done. The hospitals have really been fantastic. The hospitals, they’ve stepped up to the plate. They’ve really done a great job. We appreciate it so much. For areas less affected by the virus, we’ve issued new recommendations about how to safely resume elective treatments. HHS has also distributed the first $30 billion in direct payments to a million healthcare providers across the country. We’ve also invested $1.4 billion in community health centers to ensure our most vulnerable communities, including many African-American and Hispanic-American communities, have access to the services and testing that they need.
--
Donald Trump: (04:50)
Earlier today, vice president Pence spoke with governors from all 50 states about our unified effort to defeat the virus. He had a great call. It was a great call, very positive in I’d say every way. Prior to the call, we provided each governor with a list of the names, addresses and phone numbers of the labs where they can find additional testing capacity within their states. Many, many labs. We’re providing you with the list. We’ll show it to you now if you need it. We’ll give you the details, but hundreds and hundreds of labs are ready, willing, and able. Some of the governors, like as an example, the governor from Maryland didn’t really understand the list. He didn’t understand too much about what was going on. So now I think he’ll be able to do that. It’s pretty simple, but they have tremendous capacity and we hope to be able to help him out. We’ll work with them and work with all of the governors.
--
Donald Trump: (05:46)
Similar to the situation with ventilators, states need to assess their complete inventory of available capacity. Some states have far more capacity than they actually understand, and it is a complex subject, but some of the governors didn’t understand it. The governor, as an example Pritzker from Illinois, did not understand his capacity, not simply ask the federal government to provide unlimited support. I mean you have to take the support where you have it, but we are there to stand with the governors and to help the governors, and that’s what we’re doing and they have a tremendous capacity that we’ve already built up and you’ll be seeing that. We’re going to be introducing a couple of the folks in a little while to talk about it.
--
Donald Trump: (06:31)
I want to draw your attention to Governor Cuomos remarks during his press conference today. He said, “The President is right. The state’s testing is up. My job to coordinate those 300 labs. I think the President’s right when he says that the states should lead,” and the governors, they’re really getting… They’re getting it together in New York. A lot of good things are happening in New York, and I think the governor is going to come in to see us tomorrow. He’s coming to the Oval Office tomorrow afternoon. Andrew is going to be coming in with some of his people, so we look forward to that.
--
Donald Trump: (07:07)
Some of the articles that just recently came about, if you remember, and I put out a statement today, for a month it was all ventilator, ventilator, ventilator. It’s all people could talk about was ventilators, and we did a great job with that. We built a lot of ventilators, to put it mildly. We have so many now that at some point soon we’re going to be helping Mexico, and Italy, and other countries. We’ll be sending them the ventilators, which they desperately need. They were not in a position to build them themselves, but we have thousands being built. Every state has had… They have the ventilators. If they don’t, we have almost 10,000 in our federal reserve, our stock pile as they call it, and we did a great job with the ventilators.
--
Donald Trump: (07:58)
Unfortunately, the press doesn’t cover it other than the fair press, but so then you say, “Gee, they need ventilators. We don’t need ventilators.” And that’s under pressure we did that. Nobody that needed a ventilator in this country didn’t get one. And a story that just came out, How the Media Completely Blew the Trump Ventilator Story, I’m sure you’d love to see that. That’s by Rich Lowery, respected journalist and person. How the Media Completely Blew the Trump Ventilator Story, which unfortunately it did. And here’s another one that just came out. Kyle Smith, The Ventilator Shortage That Wasn’t. The Ventilator Shortage That Wasn’t because we got it fixed.
--
Donald Trump: (08:44)
And we’re also going to help the states, by the way, stockpile ventilators so if a thing like this should happen again they’ve got them. The stories on testing are all over the place that we’re actually in good shape. I’m going to have the vice president and others speak to you about that, but we’re in very good shape on testing and we’re getting better all the time. You’re going to see some interesting things.
--
Donald Trump: (09:07)
I thought before I went any further though, I’d like to have General Semonite, who’s done an incredible job, tell you where we are. We’re still building beds in hospitals for people that need them. I guess the hospital business general is getting pretty much closed out now, but we’re creating a lot of a space for people just in case, and in some cases they probably will be using them. But I thought the general, he’s been so impressive and done such a great job, I thought on behalf of the services and on behalf of the federal government he’d say a few words about what we’re doing right now. Thank you very. General?
--
Donald Trump: (16:31)
Fantastic, Jeff. Thank you very much. Anybody have a question for the General while he’s here? Anybody? Because I think it’s very self-explanatory. He’s done an incredible job. Jeff, do you have a question?
--
Donald Trump: (17:24)
You might say while you’re here, you’re building… The General’s in charge of the wall on the Southern border, and we want to build 450 miles of wall and it’s very much under construction. You might give them a little bit of an update. How are we doing with the wall?
--
Donald Trump: (18:44)
And we’re over 160 miles.
--
Donald Trump: (18:48)
164 miles. And we’ll have it done sometime pretty early next year. Very exciting.
--
Donald Trump: (18:56)
And you might just say one thing, the quality of that wall in terms of its power for stopping people that shouldn’t be coming into our country.
--
Donald Trump: (19:56)
Yeah, please.
--
Donald Trump: (21:46)
Okay. So you don’t really have a choice. You can stay and watch these wonderful people ask us really nice questions or you can go back to building beds.
--
Donald Trump: (21:56)
Go ahead [inaudible 00:00:21:56].
--
Donald Trump: (21:58)
Very impressive. That’s an impressive job. Isn’t it? Seriously. That’s really great. Thank you very much. He’s a terrific gentleman. We have a lot of great people doing that kind of thing that they really have to get recognition for the incredible job they are doing because I don’t think anybody else could do it. Nothing like that. And that’s on top of thousands and thousands of hospitals, and he built just in New York alone, four hospitals and 2, 900 beds, and got them done so quickly. Nobody saw anything like it. Fortunately, we haven’t had to use too many of them and that’s okay. That’s probably better news than having to use them all. Right? Because a lot of good things are happening in New York and elsewhere.
--
Donald Trump: (22:47)
So through the public, private partnerships, and deregulation, the federal government has already made immense testing capabilities available, but some states need to take action to fully utilize it. To date, the United States has conducted millions more tests than any other country. You can add them all up and they don’t catch us. And our numbers are doubling almost on, certainly on a monthly basis, but almost on a weekly basis. We’re moving very rapidly, at a number nobody thought possible. And we’ll be doubling our number of daily tests if the governors bring their states fully online through the capability that they have. We have tremendous capability out there already existing and we explained that to the governor today. Mike and all of the people explained it very strongly to the governors. They really get it now I think.
--
Donald Trump: (23:40)
As the experts have explained, this capacity is sufficient to allow states to conduct diagnostic testing to treat patients, as well as contact tracing to contain outbreaks and monitoring to pinpoint potential hotspots during phase one. And there are some hotspots and we have them pinpointed, and they can really cover it very, very nicely when they know exactly where to go, and they’re being told where to go. And also these locations where they’re going, and some of them are federal, some of the governors didn’t realize they were allowed to use federal locations. They are. And we have a booklet of the federal locations. We can hold it up. I think you’ll show that. Maybe we’ll hold it up now. Yeah. Okay, fine. But you see the number of things. These are all locations where they can go, which is really pretty amazing. This is just one page out of many. Look at this. These are all locations. That’s a lot of locations. And they can all… What is it, 5,000?
--
Donald Trump: (24:52)
Thank you very much. That’s more than anybody thought, and it’s already there. They have to use it. That’s all, they have to use it. Some weren’t aware. Some were very much aware, some weren’t aware.
--
Donald Trump: (25:03)
My administration also continues to support states with our massive operation to deliver masks, gowns, gloves and other vital supplies. Admiral Policheck and his team at FIFA are really… What a job they’ve done. And Pete, what a job he’s done. They’re calling on Easter Sunday to make sure everyone’s okay. But they are using detailed data about supply chains to track the deployment of 1 billion pieces of protective equipment through private distributors every two weeks. So what we’re doing is we’re delivering a number that nobody anywhere in the world is delivering. FEMA is working closely with Dr. Berkson, the distributors, to prioritize supply of resources where they are most needed, where finding the [inaudible 00:25:52] that they have to. They have to get to that location. We have locations that are very important to get to, and get to them fast, and that’s where they’re going. So we have a very strong priority.
--
Donald Trump: (26:03)
… and that’s where they’re going, so we have a very strong priority. This pandemic has reaffirmed the importance of keeping vital supply chains at home. We cannot outsource our independence. We cannot be reliant on foreign nations. I’ve been saying this for a long time. If we’ve learned one thing, it’s let’s do it here. Let’s build it here. Let’s make it here. We’ve got the greatest country in the world. We got to start bringing our supply chains back.
--
Donald Trump: (26:25)
Somebody years ago got this crazy idea, let’s build all over the place and let’s have parts. Let’s have a screw for a car delivered and made in a country that’s far away and let’s have a fender made someplace else and let’s do this and let’s do that and let’s put it all together. I like making it right here in the USA. I think we’ve learned a lot about that and especially maybe when it comes to pharmaceutical products.
--
Donald Trump: (26:52)
We’ve also conducted major military operations providing cities and states with additional medical capacity and the incredible 1,800 men and women from the Army Corps of Engineers. You just met with Todd. The job they’ve done is incredible, but we have nurses, doctors, we have experts in every field, all over.
--
Donald Trump: (27:16)
Spoke with governor Cuomo, spoke with Mayor de Blasio, spoke with many of the other governors that I’m both friendly, and I think I’m friendly with just about all of them if you can believe it, but I’ve gotten friendly with a lot of them. I’ve gained a lot of respect for a lot of the governors, both Republican and Democrat during this process. Some really good people, some really good talent, but we’re sending a lot of our medical people, not only our construction people like Todd Semonite, but a lot of our medical people are being sent all over the country to different locations, New York City, New York State and New Jersey. I spoke with Phil today, he’s doing a terrific job in New Jersey, but New Jersey got hit very, very hard. Phil Murphy, governor.
--
Donald Trump: (28:02)
From the day this crisis began, America launched a scientific mobilization of colossal size and scale. Someday they’ll be able to write the true story because nobody’s seen anything like it. The fake news just refuses to cover it correctly, but that’s okay. The people are understanding and that’s what matters to me.
--
Donald Trump: (28:24)
There are now 72 active trials underway across the United States researching dozens of therapies and treatments and another 211 are in the planning stages. They’re getting, I mean, they’re literally mobilizing on therapeutics and also on vaccines. A tremendous progress is being made on vaccines and I must say on therapeutics. I mean, frankly, if I had my choice, give me the therapeutics right now because that would help people right now. We have some things that I think are working. Not only working, but we have some incredible things that look like they could be an answer, but we’ll know soon, being tested, working out right now.
--
Donald Trump: (29:07)
This includes therapies designed to attack the virus as well as others that would hinder its replication, reduce the rate of infection, control the immune response or transfer lifesaving antibodies from the blood of recovered patients. One of the incredible things that we’ve seen, and Mike and I were talking about it before, is the fact oftentimes somebody gets very ill from the plague, okay, from this horrible scourge and they get better and they recover. The first thing they say is, “I want to give my blood.” That’s happened. The doctors have told me it’s happened so much. “I want to give my blood, I want to give my blood,” and they’re doing that.
--
Donald Trump: (29:49)
But tremendous things are happening. You’ll be seeing that over the weeks. I think we’ll be talking about it in the not too distant future. Johnson & Johnson’s very well along on vaccines. Again, the vaccines have to be tested. The therapeutics are for now, but a lot of good things are happening on both. But ultimately we also hope to prevent infection through a safe, a very safe vaccine. That’ll be a great thing when we have that and we will have that.
--
Donald Trump: (30:15)
With that, I’d like to introduce Admiral Giroir and Brad Smith to discuss some of the incredible things that have been done and we have, they really are. What they’ve been able to do at a very, very short period of time. Equipment, you’re going to see equipment that you haven’t seen before and if you’d just come up Brad, if you guys would come up, you could give us a little display of some of the equipment that we have and some of the things that are happening having to do with testing because testing is a big word.
--
Donald Trump: (30:47)
Remember, it was all ventilators and the reason it was all ventilators they said, “There’s no way he’ll ever be able to catch this one,” and not only did we catch it, we are now the King of Ventilators all over the world. We can send them anywhere. We have thousands being made a week and they’re very high quality and that’s wasn’t playing well.
--
Donald Trump: (31:08)
Then they said testing, testing, “Oh, we’ll get him on testing.” Well, testing is much easier than ventilator. Ventilators are big machines that are very complex, that are very expensive. You need a group of people that really know what they’re doing. We took auto lines, we took a lot of different people and now we’ve done that. But it used to be ventilators, ventilators, ventilators. Now it’s testing, testing, testing.
--
Donald Trump: (31:33)
I think the Admiral and I think that Brad will show you some things that you haven’t seen that are really a very spectacular having to do with testing. We’re way advanced, way advanced. The list I showed you, these are places you can go if you’re in the states, 5,000 different machines. 5,000, they’re all over the country and we have international also. But these are all over the country. But you’ll see something now that’s really eye-popping in terms of what they’ve done and they’ve done this under great pressure. They’ve come up with things under great pressure that are absolutely amazing.
--
Donald Trump: (32:13)
Please, if you would. Thank you, folks.
--
Donald Trump: (40:49)
Mike, please. Thank you, Brian.
--
Donald Trump: (48:23)
Thank you, Mike. Debra.
--
Donald Trump: (51:39)
Yeah.
--
Donald Trump: (57:24)
Admiral, go ahead [inaudible 00:57:23].
--
Donald Trump: (57:48)
And by the way, not everybody agrees that we have to do that much testing. We’re going maximum, you understand? There’s some people who don’t want to do that much testing, but we’re going maximum, we’re going to the outer limits. And I think that’s the way probably it should be. Jeff, go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (58:11)
Went negative.
--
Donald Trump: (58:12)
Like interest rates, they go negative.
--
Donald Trump: (58:20)
Well, it’s for short-term. Much of it has do with short sellers. Much of it has to do… If you look a month into the future, I think it’s at 25 or $28 a barrel, so a lot of people got caught. They got caught and there are a lot of people that are not too happy because they got caught. So, if you take a look at it, you’ll see it’s more of a financial thing than an oil situation. But… Because you take… I believe in a month or so, in other words go a little bit out, it’s at 25 and $28 a barrel. So it’s largely a financial squeeze. And they did get squeezed.
--
Donald Trump: (58:58)
We’ve already done that. Where, Saudi Arabia is cutting back, Russia is cutting back, Mexico is cutting back and the OPEC-plus, they call it OPEC plus additional states, are cutting back. And the problem is, nobody is driving the car anywhere in the world, essentially, 184 nations, factories are closed and businesses are closed. And so, all of a sudden we had really a lot of energy to start off with, oil in particular, we had a lot. And then all of a sudden, they lost 40/50% of their market, so it just stops. So, it’s going to be picking up and the energy business will be strong. But they cut back… It could be 20 million barrels, but it’s let’s say 15, and that was between Russia and Saudi Arabia. But this had to do with the squeeze and it was a very tough squeeze. So, a lot of people got-
--
Donald Trump: (59:48)
Well, they got to do more by the market, to be honest. Look, same thing over here. If the market is the way it is, people are going to slow it down or they going to stop. That’s going to be automatic, and that’s happening.
--
Donald Trump: (01:00:29)
If you give me the name of the company and his name, I’ll have that checked out, John. I’ll do that. It’s a friend of yours?
--
Donald Trump: (01:00:38)
Why did he call you? He called you to say he’s a criminal and why did he get along or what’s…
--
Donald Trump: (01:00:47)
Okay. If you give me the name, I’ll look into it. I’d like to look into that.
--
Donald Trump: (01:00:51)
Caitlin, go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:00:58)
Which companies, you’re talking about? Under what?
--
Donald Trump: (01:01:06)
So, we have… I’ll give you an answer to that. I’ll give you a legal answer to that when we look it up, but we’re trying to take liability away from these companies. We just don’t want that. Because we want the companies to open and open strong, but I’ll get you a legal opinion on that.
--
Donald Trump: (01:01:18)
I’ll get you… Well, that’s what I’m saying. I’ll get you a legal opinion on that.
--
Donald Trump: (01:01:22)
Nobody has discussed it, no. But we will, now.
--
Donald Trump: (01:01:29)
Not one.
--
Donald Trump: (01:01:30)
Not at this point. But we’re going to look, because they have talked about general liability, so I’ll get you a specific answer from the lawyers. Go ahead, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:01:53)
[crosstalk 01:01:52], but you know the price of oil right now, don’t you?
--
Donald Trump: (01:01:58)
I do. I actually do.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:00)
Of course, nobody has ever heard of negative oil before, but it’s for short-term.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:15)
Yes.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:19)
Well, at the price you’re talking about, you don’t need funding. They pay you, see.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:22)
Because, right now… Well, if you can get it, that’s true. If you can get it.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:32)
Well, at a minimum, we’ll let people store. So, we’ll store it. We’ll use it as storage and charge for it. But people need storage desperately, and we have massive storage under the petroleum.
--
Donald Trump: (01:02:47)
It’s not a question of requirement. If we could buy it for nothing, we’re going to take everything we can get. The only thing I like better than that is where they pay you to take the oil, but that’s a short term squeeze. You understand that. So, it’s… I don’t think you’re going to see that. But no, we’d like to have Congress… This is a great time to buy oil. And we’d like to have Congress approve it so that we could instead of just storing it for the big, usually the big companies… Because, I think we have 75 million gallons right now, capacity. That’s a lot. It’s… We’ve been building it up over a period of time, but that’s a lot. 75 billion barrels. So we’re going to get… Either ask for permission to buy it or we’ll store it. One way or the other, it will be full. Please.

Donald Trump: (01:03:31)
Go ahead. [crosstalk 00:11:33], finish up. We’ll go right to you.
--
Donald Trump: (01:03:45)
Well, we’ll look at it. I heard, just as I’m walking into the room, we certainly have plenty of oil. So I’ll take a look at that. Yes, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:04:05)
Well, we don’t… We really don’t need it. We use it, we go up… And I’ve used it a lot. But we use it and then sometimes all they have to do is see it coming. Do you want to talk about that admiral, please?
--
Donald Trump: (01:04:58)
And we don’t want to embarrass people either. Please Brad, go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:06:25)
So that way you meant, if the machines were utilized, that would be-
--
Donald Trump: (01:06:40)
For? Yes.
--
Donald Trump: (01:12:39)
And take a look at that map. If the Governor of Maryland could have called Mike Pence, he could have saved a lot of money. Look at all of the… Look at these different places, and that’s Maryland right there. So, he could have saved a lot of money, but that’s okay.
--
Donald Trump: (01:12:53)
No, I don’t think he needed to go to South Korea. I think he needed to get a little knowledge, would have been helpful.
--
Donald Trump: (01:13:10)
Well, I know one thing, I didn’t get any, that’s for sure. I didn’t get any. We’ll look at individual things, and some people will have to return it if we think it’s inappropriate
--
Donald Trump: (01:13:21)
Well, it’s being done by great professionals, it’s being done by banks, and as you know community banks all over the country, they’re… That’s what they do. They loan money and they’re supposed to do it according to not only criteria, but according to what we think is right. But if somebody got something that we think is inappropriate, we’ll get it back. Good point. Please, go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:13:56)
Well, I think that South Korea… I had a great talk with President Moon, he’s a friend of mine. I congratulate… He had a wonderful election victory. I was very happy about that. He was… As you know, just recently… No, we are negotiating for President Moon and for South Korea to help us monetarily. Because, we, as you know, we have 32,000 soldiers there, that varies from 28 to 32,000 in South Korea. And we think that… Before I came aboard, they paid very little, if anything. So we’re defending a wonderful nation, a nation that we have great relationships, but we’re asking them to pay for a big percentage of what we’re doing. It’s not fair. So, it’s not a question of reduction. It’s a question of will they contribute toward the defense of their own nation. We’re defending nations that are very wealthy. South Korea is a very wealthy nation. They make our television sets, they make ships, they make everything, and I give them great credit.
--
Donald Trump: (01:14:56)
We’ve been defending them for many decades, as you know, many… Over eight decades. And I’ve gone to them in the past. Last year I went to them and now they’re paying $1 billion a year. And I went to them again, I said, “Look, I’ll be back because that’s just a fraction.” And again, the relationship is a great, but it’s just not a fair relationship. We renegotiated the trade deal and made it a much more equitable deal than it was in the past. It was a terrible deal. It was done by Hillary Clinton. It was a terrible deal. The new deal is a much more equitable deal that’s on trade. But on the military, I mean, we’re paying for the military to defend another nation that’s 8,500 miles away. And they’re not the only one I’m talking to by the way, as you know. I won’t go into names. But I’ve done this, nobody talks about it.
--
Donald Trump: (01:15:45)
But I think it’s appropriate. I think the taxpayer of our country… Taxpayers want to hear these things. And so now, they’re… They’ve offered us a certain amount of money and I’ve rejected it. I just said, “It’s just… Look, we’re doing a tremendous service. We have a wonderful feeling and a wonderful relationship with each other, but we have to be treated equitably and fairly.” And so, that’s where it is right now. And what’s going to happen, I can’t tell you, but we’ll find out fairly soon. But, I congratulate the president who’s a friend of mine. I congratulate President Moon on having a terrific victory. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:16:27)
Sure.
--
Donald Trump: (01:16:46)
Well, we’re going to be talking about that in phase four, as you know, which we’ll start very shortly. That has to do with infrastructure, hopefully infrastructure, because this country needs infrastructure. We spend all this money in the Middle East, $8 trillion, with a T, dollars in the Middle East. But if you have a pothole in a highway someplace, they don’t want you to spend the money to fix it. How stupid have we been in this country? How stupid have we been? And that’s changing rapidly, you know that, you’ve seen that. Including things like negotiating with friends. But when we are helping friends, friends should reimburse us for the cost.
--
Donald Trump: (01:17:23)
I mean, why should we be defending nations for free? We’re defending a nation for free. Now I’m getting $1 billion a year and we’re… We’ll be getting… We were offered much more than that, but I turned it down. So that’s where we are with that. As far as the other is concerned, look, we have to be smart in this country. We’ve been taken to the cleaner by every… And I mean, with allies, not just with the enemies, with allies. We’ve been to… Frankly, the allies have taken us much more so than the enemies. The enemies we don’t do business with, right? The allies we do business with… And whoever made these deals, whoever made these contracts, in many cases, we didn’t have a contract. We didn’t have a contract…
--
Donald Trump: (01:18:03)
In many cases, we didn’t have a contract, like we didn’t have a contract, we didn’t have a trade deal with China. They came in and they took $500 billion a year for many years, but anywhere from 200 to $550 billion a year out of our hides. Now we made this great trade deal. Unfortunately, that was a number of months ago and it’s a great deal. They’re paying 25% on $250 billion. A lot of things happening. They’re going to have to purchase $250 billion worth of goods, including farm product up to $50 billion. So a lot of good things are happening. But then what happened with China was the plague hit us, right, the plague. That was after. This was long after we signed the deal. The plague hit us, so I’m not happy about that. Okay. John, please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:20:32)
John, what a good question that was. Where did that come from?
--
Donald Trump: (01:20:36)
No, that’s very impressive. You know when Senator Schumer wrote a letter a couple of months ago and he said, “You should use admirals and generals.” I said, “Well, first of all, we have our Vice President has been incredible, but we have the admirals, we have the generals,” and I was just talking to the Admiral inside just before we came out. I said, “Did you go to Annapolis?” He said, “No, sir.” I said, “Oh, that’s too bad. That’s too bad. Where did you go?” He said, “I went to Harvard.” Oh, that’s okay too, I guess. Right? So you went to Harvard and he was a great student at Harvard. He’s doing a fantastic job. And this young gentleman was very, very successful, but he wanted to help the country. He wanted to come into the country and we appreciate it very much. He was a big success, big, big success. Let’s do here and there next. Okay. We’re all set. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:21:33)
I don’t know. He wanted to [crosstalk 01:21:35] and we believe it or not, we get along, okay? He was very generous yesterday in particular, said we did a “phenomenal deal.” I don’t know if anybody wrote that, but he said that and I appreciated it because it’s not about me. It’s about these people and thousands behind Mike, and the Admiral, and all of the other people that are working with us. I mean, and you see it. Look, I don’t understand when I see a polling and approval ratings for the job. I mean, this group should get a 95. It really should. And we’re really helping the governors. And the governors call me, the ones I know, or the Republicans, but the ones I know, and they say it’s incredible the job you’re doing. Again, not me, the job this group is doing. And you sit here and I’m watching from the corner and I’m just saying, boy, it’s incredible stuff.
--
Donald Trump: (01:22:29)
When you watch the General get up, General Semonite, and talk about boom, boom, boom. You don’t see that. You don’t see that. When you hear the Admiral speak about the testing, how good it is, and yet people don’t like to say it. But remember, it was all about ventilators a month ago. Ventilators, ventilators, then we fixed it. You don’t hear about ventilators. Where is the ventilator? Jeff, you haven’t asked about ventilators recently. What’s going on? What about ventilators? We’re helping other countries now because they can’t have, they’re very hard to come by and they take a long time to make, like years.
--
Donald Trump: (01:23:02)
It’s incredible the job they’ve done, that our people have done, and also private companies have done. You know, you talk about the Act. We don’t like to use it unless we have to, but a lot of times just the fact that you have it, gets you everything you need. So you know, we don’t want to embarrass any of the companies, but we have used it on a number of occasions, and it worked. But it works just as well before you have to use it because they don’t want to be embarrassed and I don’t want to embarrass them because they’ve done a great job. Please go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:23:32)
No, I think Rick behind you. I promised. I cannot tell a lie. So I mean we’ll get you next. Okay?
--
Donald Trump: (01:23:38)
No no, you.
--
Donald Trump: (01:24:06)
Well, it’s not bipartisan. It’s mostly partisan, but more importantly than mostly partisan, it’s incorrect. You have the experts. Look at these maps. I mean, you have the maps with so many different locations. In the case of, as an example, Governor Hogan, he didn’t really know. It was very obvious to any of those listening to the call today, even though you weren’t supposed to be on it, I’m sure that some of you were, or representatives were, he really didn’t know about the federal laboratories. Would you say that’s correct, Mike? He didn’t know. He didn’t know and Mike doesn’t like to get into this stuff. He’s less controversial than I am, but he didn’t know about it. And if he did know about it, he would have been happy. No, we’ve done a really good job in testing. Now, with that being said, we have tests coming out perhaps over the next two weeks that will blow the whole industry away.
--
Donald Trump: (01:24:57)
Now, a lot of people love the Abbot tests. So do I. You know, the Abbott test is great because it’s boom, they touch, they put it in, in five minutes you have… The problem is that doesn’t do massive numbers like the big machine. But the big machine takes a day, takes a day and a half with delivery and everything else. But we have tremendous testing, tremendous testing capability. Remember this, we’ve tested more than any country in the world by far. In fact, I think I read where if you add up every other country in the world, we’ve tested more.
--
Donald Trump: (01:25:33)
But remember this, we’re dealing in politics. We’re dealing with a thing called November 3rd of this year. Do you know what November 3rd represents? Right? You know better than anybody in the room. November 3rd of this year, it’s called the presidential election. No matter what I do, no matter where we go, no matter how well we do, no matter what, if I came up with a tablet, you take it and this plague is gone, they’ll say Trump did a terrible job, terrible, terrible. Because that’s their soundbite. That’s the political soundbite. They know the great job we’ve done.
--
Donald Trump: (01:26:08)
But with all of that being said, and also, there is a thing that somebody could talk to if they want, but I don’t want to bore you with it. Not everybody believes we should do so much testing. You don’t need so much. We’re talking about maximum maximum. The reason that the Democrats and some others maybe because they don’t know, they want maximum because they want to be able to criticize, because it’s almost impossible to get to the maximum number, and yet we’ve been able to do it already. But with that, and you’ll be seeing this over the next, I think over the next couple of weeks or sooner, we have a test. If it comes out, it’ll revolutionize the whole world of testing. It’ll be something really special. So I don’t view it as personal at all. What I do say is it’s something that’s not fair to thousands of people that have done such a good job.
--
Donald Trump: (01:27:24)
And a lot of people love Trump, right? A lot of people love me. You see them all the time, right? I guess I’m here for a reason, you know. To the best of my knowledge, I won, and I think we’re going to win again. I think we’re going to win in a landslide. But just so you understand, you’re talking about March, right? And yet, [crosstalk 01:27:42] excuse me, excuse me. I know, I understand. And yet in January, a certain date, you know the date better than I do, we put on a ban of China where China can’t come in, and before March we put on a ban in Europe where Europe can’t come in. So how could you say I wasn’t taking it seriously? You know, I put on a ban on China before anybody in this country died. I put on a ban and so you tell me. Nancy Pelosi, she wanted to have a street party in Chinatown in San Francisco at the end of February.
--
Donald Trump: (01:28:18)
That’s a month later. And then they tell me it’s only a political talking point, but you feed into it because you’re too good a reporter to let that happen. Really, you are a good reporter. You’re too good a reporter to let that happen. Remember this. So at the end of January, I put on a ban. People that were in that room will tell you. I think there were 21 people. I was the only one in the whole room that wanted to do it. Fortunately, I was the one that counted for that purpose. We put on a ban because I was reading bad things about China. World Health Organization should have told us, but I was reading it with or without them. They should have known. All they had to do is read it. They didn’t have to even be there, but they tried to cover up for China.
--
Donald Trump: (01:28:55)
World Health covered up for China. [crosstalk 01:28:58] But no, no wait, but you can’t say this. I put on a ban. In other words, I stopped China from coming to the United States. I stopped Europe from coming into the United States long before the March date that you’re talking about. So people should say I acted very early. That was a very hard thing to do. Doing that was a very hard thing. I didn’t want to do that. [crosstalk 01:29:19] But I did it because I thought, and Dr. Fauci said that by doing it, President Trump saved tens of thousands of lives. So I did take it very seriously.
--
Donald Trump: (01:29:32)
Oh, I don’t know about rallies. I really don’t know about rallies. I know one thing [crosstalk 01:29:35], I haven’t left the White House in months, except for a brief moment to give a wonderful ship, The Comfort-
--
Donald Trump: (01:29:45)
I don’t know. Did I hold a rally? I’m sorry. I hold a rally. Did I hold the rally? Let me tell you. In January when I did this, you had virtually no cases and no deaths, and yet I put it on. So how could I not? Why was Nancy Pelosi, right, Nancy Pelosi is holding a street fair. She wants a street fair in San Francisco in Chinatown to prove, you know what the purpose of it, was to prove that there’s no problem. Many other politicians did the same thing and wanted to prove [crosstalk 01:30:16] while I was… No, of course not. No, no, no. People are amazed at how early I acted and I did act early. With that being said, it’s very hard to say, let’s close down the greatest economy in the history of the world. I had it closed down, I and everybody else that works with me, and close to 350 million people built the greatest economy in the history of the world, best employment numbers, best stock market numbers, best numbers in virtually every category, even good manufacturing numbers.
--
Donald Trump: (01:30:48)
The previous administration said manufacturing was dead for our country, even great manufacturing numbers and you know what? I did that and somebody walked into my office and said, “Sir, you’re going to have to close down the economy. You’re going to have to close the country.” But you know what I say to you? We’re going to rebuild it, and we’re going to rebuild it better, and it’s going to go faster than people think. I built it once. I build it a second time. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (01:31:14)
Please. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:31:42)
I think it’s a great question because there is bipartisanship. Look, we’re getting the paycheck plan. It’s already 350 billion was approved, essentially unanimously, and we have another 250 which I think you’re going to find out is going to be a higher number than that. Okay. I won’t say it now because I don’t know if they’ve released it or not, but it’s going to end up being more than 250 billion, and this is going to small businesses, and is going to workers, and these are really bipartisan plans. It’s a great thing that’s happening. So I think the fact that we’re able to do all of this in a bipartisan way is great.
--
Donald Trump: (01:32:18)
Now the tax cuts that the Republicans did, we had no help from the Democrats. So you can’t say that’s bipartisan, but this whole thing getting our country back, and you know, Nancy Pelosi’s been, she’s very nasty. She wasted a lot of time with a impeachment hoax. It was a total hoax, went nowhere, and that was not good. And Schumer, I guess it’s the same thing, but he sort of accepted it. He just did what he was supposed to do and he didn’t do very well with it. But you know, that was not appropriate. That was a bad thing for our country. But it was fine. I mean, I understand the game. They have a little bit of a majority, so they say, let’s do something and let’s try and stir it up.
--
Donald Trump: (01:32:58)
But they wasted a year. They wasted tremendous. We could have been doing things that would have been great for our country. They could have been looking into China. They should have been looking into China as an example. A lot of people are blaming the Democrats for wasting all that time because it was during that period of time, as you know, that it was fomenting, but I think we’ve had a great spirit of bipartisanship in a certain way.
--
Donald Trump: (01:33:21)
I wouldn’t say we’re going to set records throughout the world, but things are happening that are very good. The country is coming together, and I’ll tell you what, the people are coming together. The people are really coming together. I think you’re going to find that our country is much more unified. I do think that the press, the media foments a lot of anger. I really believe it foments tremendous anger. For instance, I’ll be asked a tremendously hostile question from somebody, and then I’ll answer it in a hostile way, which is appropriate. otherwise you look foolish. Otherwise it looks like just walk off the stage and bow your head. I can’t do that. You know? I just can’t do that. But a lot of these questions that are asked from certain networks are so hostile and there’s no reason for it.
--
Donald Trump: (01:34:10)
There’s no reason for it. We are in a war. This is a World War II. This is a World War I, where by the way, the war essentially ended because of a plague. That was one of the worst ever. They lost almost a hundred million people. But we’re in a big war. And I’ll say one thing about, because I think it’s important, the last person, I did it early, but I was the last person that wanted to close down one of the great economic, you can’t call it an experiment, but everything I guess in life is an experiment. So let’s say experiments, but one of the great economic stories in history, I’m the last person that wanted to do it, but we did the right thing, because if we didn’t do it, you would’ve had a million people, a million and a half people, maybe two million people dead.
--
Donald Trump: (01:34:59)
Now we’re going toward 50, I’m hearing, or 60,000 people. One is too many. I always say it. One is too many, but we’re going toward 50 or 60,000 people. That’s at the lower, as you know, the low number was supposed to be 100,000 people. We could end up at 50 to 60. Okay, it’s horrible. If we didn’t do what we did, we would have had, I think, a million people, maybe 2 million people, maybe more than that. And you look it, there’s one country in particular that decided let’s wing it. Let’s just keep going. They are being inundated with death.
--
Donald Trump: (01:35:43)
Now if you take a look at some of the hospitals, where one of them I knew growing up in Queens, and I’m looking at the bodies laying in hallways being brought into refrigerator trucks, the trucks, these massive trucks, bodies going in, multiply that times 10. It’s not sustainable. And many of the people that have this theory, Oh let’s, you know, maybe we could have just gone right through. I was somebody that would have loved to have done that, but it wouldn’t have been sustainable. You can’t lose a million people. That’s almost double what we lost in the Civil War. I use that as a guide, Civil War, 600,000 people died. So it’s not sustainable.
--
Donald Trump: (01:36:28)
But it could have been much more than a million people. I mean if you took a number and cut it in half and half and in half again, you’d end up at 500,000 people, okay, if you want to make a very conservative guesstimate. 500,000 people is not acceptable. Is that a correct sort of an analogy? So I mean I see it all the time. My friends of mine, people that I have great respect for. Well we could have done this, we could have done, and remember this, when we say 50 and they compare 50 to the 35 of the flu, because it’s averaged 35, 36,000 over a 10 year period. It’s a lot. Who would think that?
--
Donald Trump: (01:37:03)
But we’re not talking about with the flu. It just goes. We’re not locking ourselves in our units. We’re not locking ourselves in our apartments and not moving and not touching anybody and just saying, you know, the world. In this case we are, and we’re still going to lose between 50 and 60, but if we just kept it going on a normal basis, which is really the only standard that you can compare it to with the flu, because that was a normal basis. You get into an airplane, you travel to Florida, you go to Texas, you go wherever you’re going. But in this case, if we didn’t do anything, the number wouldn’t be 50 to 60,000, the number would be a million people dead. It would be 1,000,005, 1,000,002, maybe 700,000. It would have been a number in like that, and it’s so important because I see so much.
--
Donald Trump: (01:37:57)
Oh well, you know. You can’t compare it because I’ll tell you what, the people of this country, what they’ve done, they’ve gone out of their had the way they’ve lived. It’s not great. It’s terrible. Maybe the first three days, they’re all of a sudden, you see what’s going on. They want to get going, and I get that fully. But I just say this. If we would have done that, we would’ve lost anywhere from a million to more than two million people. Now, with all of the death that we’ve seen at 50 or 60,000 people heading toward, right now it’s at 40, but 50 or 60,000 people, probably over 54, and [inaudible 01:38:37], but that’s with our guard up. If we took our guard down and just said, “Okay, we’re just going to keep this open,” we would have lost millions of people.
--
Donald Trump: (01:38:47)
Can you imagine? Look how bad it looks now when you look at the bodies, when you look at Hart Island in New York where they have the mass grave, and all of the things that you see, can you imagine if we had the guard down, if we didn’t do anything and we just said, “Let’s ride it out?” It would not have been sustainable in any way. It would have been an atrocity. So we’ve done the right thing. We’ve really done the right thing. And the people that have worked so hard and dangerously, I’ll tell you again, I say it, but I watched those doctors and nurses and medical people running into those hospitals, and they don’t even have that gear on. Forget about gear, whether it’s great gear or not, and we’re bringing in the best gear in the world, but they’re running in with open everything.
--
Donald Trump: (01:39:35)
I mean, the job, they like warriors, the job they’re doing. But if we didn’t do the moves that we made, you would have had a million, a million and a half, 2 million people dead. So multiply that times 50, you’re talking about you would’ve had 10 to 20 to 25 times more people dead than all of the people that we’ve been watching. That’s not acceptable. The 50,000 is not acceptable. It’s so horrible. But can you imagine multiplying that out by 20 or more? It’s not acceptable. So it’s a very good question. I appreciate it. We’ll see you tomorrow. We’ll see you tomorrow.
Donald Trump: (01:52)
Thank you very much everyone. Thank you.

Donald Trump: (01:59)
We continue to see evidence that our aggressive strategy is working and working at a very high level. Nationwide, the percent of tests that come back positive has declined very significantly. Last week, roughly 38% of the tests in New York were positive. This week that number is down to 28%. New cases in New York are down 50% compared to a week ago and fatalities are down 40% over the same period.
--
Donald Trump: (02:29)
In Louisiana, the rate of positive tests results decline from 25% down to 15% in the last seven days alone. 18 States now show a decline in a number of positive tests in the last seven days. So over the last seven days has been very, very significant progress.
--
Donald Trump: (02:49)
Half of all Americans live in States that have now taken steps to open their economies. Just yesterday, governors, Gavin Newsom, California, Tim Waltz of Minnesota and Billy of Tennessee announced additional plans to restart certain sectors. We ask every American to maintain vigilance and hygiene, social distancing and voluntary use of face coverings.
--
Donald Trump: (03:15)
We’re opening our country. It’s very exciting to see. We have a lot of talent involved from governors down to people that just stand there and help you with the doors. There’s been tremendous talent involved and tremendous spirit from our country. Our country is a great place and it’s going to be greater than ever before. I really believe that. I think there’s going to be a tremendous upward shift. I spoke with Tim cook today of Apple and they have a good sense of the market and he feels it’s going to be a V. The V is sharply upward later on as we actually get it fully open.
--
Donald Trump: (03:55)
Today I signed the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act providing $320 billion to keep American workers on the payroll. $30 billion of the Paycheck Protection Funds will be reserved for small financial institutions including those that serve minority and distressed communities, extending vital relief to thousands of African American and Hispanic American, small business owners and their employees. The Bill also delivers $75 billion for hospitals, so badly needed for hospitals. They’ve taken a very big hit and medical providers in areas less effected by the virus, hospitals and doctors should work with their state and local health officials on ways to safely resume elective medical treatments and care.
--
Donald Trump: (04:46)
Under the CARES Act, we’re sending direct payments to millions of American workers. More than 80 million Americans have already received their payment. $3,400 for a typical family of four, $3,400 that’s great, and you deserve it. The CARES Act requires that the federal government send out a notice of what benefits Americans are receiving. To fulfill the requirement, the treasury department is mailing a letter to me. It will include the amount, their economic impact payment, how it will arrive, direct deposit, check or prepaid debit card as well as a message to the nation, letting each American know that we are getting through this challenge together as one American family and that’s what’s been happening. The whole world is watching this. You have 184 countries out there that have been hit and now it’s probably higher than that, but they’re all watching us. They’re all watching and they’re calling and they respect what we’re doing so much.

Donald Trump: (05:49)
I spoke with the leaders of numerous countries today. They’re asking if we can send them ventilators and I’m agreeing to do it. We have tremendous capacity, now, over capacity of ventilators. We’re filling up stockpiles for our States and for ourselves. Federal government has over 10,000 ventilators and we could have a lot more if we wanted to do that, but we’re helping Mexico, Honduras, Indonesia, France. We’re sending to France, we’re sending to Spain, we’re sending to Italy and we’ll probably be sending to Germany should they need them.

Donald Trump: (06:23)
Over the last three years, we built the strongest economy and the most successful country the world has ever seen, greatest economy the world has ever seen. Nobody’s ever done anything like what we were able to do and we will rebuild that economy, our economy in the not too distant future. I really believe with all that we’ve learned and all that we’ve done, will be just as strong and maybe stronger than ever before, even stronger than it was just two months ago.

Donald Trump: (06:54)
Some interesting notice that the FDA approved, the first at home COVID-19 test kit just got approved and doctor Steven… Where is Steven? Steven Hahn is going to say a couple of words about that and some other things. I want to thank Steven. The FDA has been incredible. They’ve been approving not only this, but they’ve been approving many things at a pace that’s never happened before. And they’re being very safe about it, as Steven told me, he’s told me very strongly, but at the same time they’re approving things at record numbers at a record rate, and it’s really been helpful. Many tests are going on, many vaccine tests and tests of every different kind and things are happening just like this event, things are happening very rapidly and I’d like to have Steven tell you a little bit about it. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (01:52)
Thank you very much everyone. Thank you.

Donald Trump: (01:59)
We continue to see evidence that our aggressive strategy is working and working at a very high level. Nationwide, the percent of tests that come back positive has declined very significantly. Last week, roughly 38% of the tests in New York were positive. This week that number is down to 28%. New cases in New York are down 50% compared to a week ago and fatalities are down 40% over the same period.
--
Donald Trump: (02:29)
In Louisiana, the rate of positive tests results decline from 25% down to 15% in the last seven days alone. 18 States now show a decline in a number of positive tests in the last seven days. So over the last seven days has been very, very significant progress.
--
Donald Trump: (02:49)
Half of all Americans live in States that have now taken steps to open their economies. Just yesterday, governors, Gavin Newsom, California, Tim Waltz of Minnesota and Billy of Tennessee announced additional plans to restart certain sectors. We ask every American to maintain vigilance and hygiene, social distancing and voluntary use of face coverings.
--
Donald Trump: (03:15)
We’re opening our country. It’s very exciting to see. We have a lot of talent involved from governors down to people that just stand there and help you with the doors. There’s been tremendous talent involved and tremendous spirit from our country. Our country is a great place and it’s going to be greater than ever before. I really believe that. I think there’s going to be a tremendous upward shift. I spoke with Tim cook today of Apple and they have a good sense of the market and he feels it’s going to be a V. The V is sharply upward later on as we actually get it fully open.
--
Donald Trump: (03:55)
Today I signed the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act providing $320 billion to keep American workers on the payroll. $30 billion of the Paycheck Protection Funds will be reserved for small financial institutions including those that serve minority and distressed communities, extending vital relief to thousands of African American and Hispanic American, small business owners and their employees. The Bill also delivers $75 billion for hospitals, so badly needed for hospitals. They’ve taken a very big hit and medical providers in areas less effected by the virus, hospitals and doctors should work with their state and local health officials on ways to safely resume elective medical treatments and care.
--
Donald Trump: (04:46)
Under the CARES Act, we’re sending direct payments to millions of American workers. More than 80 million Americans have already received their payment. $3,400 for a typical family of four, $3,400 that’s great, and you deserve it. The CARES Act requires that the federal government send out a notice of what benefits Americans are receiving. To fulfill the requirement, the treasury department is mailing a letter to me. It will include the amount, their economic impact payment, how it will arrive, direct deposit, check or prepaid debit card as well as a message to the nation, letting each American know that we are getting through this challenge together as one American family and that’s what’s been happening. The whole world is watching this. You have 184 countries out there that have been hit and now it’s probably higher than that, but they’re all watching us.

Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (00:12)
Thank you. Thank you very much. It’s a great honor to have you all. I know your stories. I got to read about your stories. In some cases, I knew your story without having to read about it from Staten Island, so thank you all very much. Great honor to have you. This afternoon, we’re going to recognize several individuals who have responded to the invisible enemy with courage, determination, and grace. Terrific people. In recent weeks, our nation has endured extraordinary hardships and loss and we mourn with one heart for every life that’s been taken from us. In the midst of so much pain, the heroes we honor today are a true source of inspiration for us all. You really are a very great inspiration for us all and the whole country is watching. With us today is Kyle West from Cincinnati, Ohio. Kyle is 23 years old and he’s proud to be a mailman in his hometown. I know Cincinnati very well. I actually worked in Cincinnati and it was great. The queen city.
--
Donald Trump: (01:17)
I had a great experience. Many of the people in this route are older Americans in a low-income area, and as Kyle says of his job, “We’re not just mailman. We’re mechanics, movers, and many other things. We’re part of the neighborhood.” That’s true, isn’t that for a mailman? Kyle talks to roughly 500 of his customers each day, bringing a cheerful smile and a listening ear to every parcel of mail. When the pandemic kit Kyle delivered a note to hundreds of older Americans on his route. It said, “If you are at risk and need help getting essential items, let me know. I will do what I can to help.” That means you get it done, right? That’s what he means. Sincerely, mailman Kyle. Since then, Kyle has received more than 400 responses and he’s delivered vital groceries to dozens of senior citizens. Kyle, your love for your neighbors lifts us and the entire nation. Would you come up and say a few words please? Thank you, Kyle. It’s terrific. I’ll move that down for you.
--
Donald Trump: (03:53)
Great job. Thank you very much, Kyle. Also, with us are Libby Bish and Raphael Melo and they’re real estate agents in Northern Virginia. Great business, real estate. When one of their clients told them that his restaurant had been hit hard, Libby and Rafael decided they wanted to do something to help. They began raising money to buy food from restaurants to donate to local hospitals. Within a few weeks they’ve raised over $6,000, made 18 deliveries, and fed over 500 healthcare workers and Libby and Raphael please, I’d like to thank you and acknowledge you by having you step forward and say a few words, please. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (06:29)
Thanks very much. Great job. Tall guy, right? So, how tall are you?
--
Donald Trump: (06:39)
6’8″. That’s a good height. I have a son that looks like he’s going to be right around that number. Barron, right? He’s going to be up there. That’s really good. Thank you very much and thank you Libby very much. Today we also honor TJ Kim, a high school sophomore from McLean, Virginia. TJ hopes to serve as a pilot in the United States Navy. At just 16 years old, 16, boy, that’s a great age. TJ is already taking flight classes to get his pilot’s license. When he heard that hospitals needed more personal protective equipment, he launched his own mission, Operation SOS, which stands for Supplies Over the Skies.
--
Donald Trump: (07:21)
He worked with his school, church, and community to collect medical supplies with the help of the flight instructor who probably was a very good person. What do you think? Pretty good. Good flight instructor too? Knows how to fly right? Pretty good. You better take lessons from somebody that knows how to fly, but who also joins us today and TJ has flown and delivered more than 10,000 pieces of personal protective equipment. That’s a lot of work. That’s a lot of flying too. That’s great. And there can be no better preparation for flying the military planes. I think it can be nothing better, but you’re going to four rural hospitals in Virginia, so TJ, come on up and say a few words. Please. It’d be an honor. Thank you.
--
Donald Trump: (10:21)
That’s fantastic.
--
Donald Trump: (10:29)
That’s great. Where’s your flight instructor?
--
Donald Trump: (10:34)
Well, how about standing up? Was he a great student? He did a good job. You did a good job out there. Thank you.
--
Donald Trump: (10:48)
Fantastic story. So, a man that I know because I spent a lot of time and spend in a place called Staten Island. Right. That’s true. Frank Siller from Staten Island, New York. Really special place. I spent many an hour, many a day with my father there over the years, and it’s just great. Nearly two decades ago, Frank founded an organization called Tunnel to Towers to support the loved ones of the fallen first responders and service members. He began this mission to honor the legacy of his younger brother, firefighter Stephen Siller, and so Steven’s looking down right now and he says, “My brother’s in the White House doing a real job.” He’s very proud of you. I know how hard you work. Coming from New York, I guess especially, Frank I know how hard you work, and you’ve done a fantastic job. We appreciate it very much, but he was one of the immortal heroes who gave his life when September 11th, 2001.
--
Donald Trump: (11:58)
As the virus began to spread in New York earlier this year, Frank leaped into action. He helped raise money to deliver more than 1 million pieces of personal protective equipment. That’s a lot for hospitals in the city. Frank and his army of volunteers have delivered food to firehouses and phone stations and police stations and all sorts of places all across New York and New Jersey. Frank also raised over $5 million to help pay the mortgages of families’ homes. That 25 first responders, I guess it’s a total of 25 so you have a lot of people that are very thankful, Frank. I’ve heard a lot about it. First responders and healthcare workers who have tragically lost their lives in the fight against the virus. It’s a vicious, vicious enemy. Frank, I want to thank you for continuing to support our nation’s heroes and again, your family and your brother is very proud of you, looking down and please come up and say a few words Frank, please. Thank you.
--
Donald Trump: (15:47)
Great job. Thank you very much, Frank. Beautiful.
--
Donald Trump: (15:51)
In this hour of need, the world has once again witnessed the unbeatable strength of the United States of America. All across our land, heroes have raced into action. Doctors and nurses are enduring sleepless nights to save every possible life. Farmers, truck drivers, and grocers are working to keep our shelves stocked and our people fed. Families are helping neighbors in need and entire communities are rallying together to defeat the plague. This ugly, horrible plague. The five Americans we recognized today are the first of a number of individuals we will honor in the coming weeks. We’re going to be honoring a lot of great people. Our nation has just completed the 30 days to slow the spread during which every American was asked to make sacrifices to help defeat the virus. Not long ago, models predicted that between 1.5 million and 2.2 million people would have died in the United States without the mitigation.
--
Donald Trump: (16:50)
Through our aggressive response and the remarkable commitment and bravery of American people, we have saved thousands and thousands of lives. I can even make that if you want hundreds of thousands of lives. People were thinking in terms of 1.5 million lives lost to 2.2 without the mitigation and hopefully, we’re going to come in below that hundred thousand lives lost, which is a horrible number, nevertheless. It’s a horrible thing. Could have been stopped. Should have been stopped at the source, but it wasn’t, but it’s a tribute to this country and the people of our country, what they’ve been able to do and the amount of lives that have been saved. Because we flattened the curve, slowed the spread, and massively expanded our healthcare capacity, we’re now in the process of gradually reopening our country and it’s being done with a tremendous gusto and vigor.
--
Donald Trump: (17:51)
We see that all the time, don’t we Frank? They want to get out there and they want to get back. That’s what they want. They want their country back and they’re getting it back and we’re getting it back safely and we’re getting it back quickly. It’s a strategy guided by science, evidence, facts, and reason. Never-ending lockdown would inflict colossal damage on the health and lifespans of our people. Public health is closely tied to economic health. No state or country can long ignore the facts and the truth and we’re just very proud of the fact that people have put up with so much in order to keep the numbers down to the level that it looks like we’ll be having. Our finished number should be something. Think of it, we could save anywhere from a million to even 1,000,005. And I guess, if you think about it, we could save 2.1, 2.5 million lives depending on what happens.
--
Donald Trump: (18:47)
And with this invisible enemy, as we said, nobody knows what really happens, but we’ve learned a lot in the last two months. Throughout our history, it’s America’s love and strength, not its fears and doubts that have paved the way and paved the road to victory. Together we’ll emerge from this chapter of hardship and all of those deaths of such great souls and such great people. With new unity and resolve, our people will thrive, our industries will roar, our innovators will astonish, and America will triumph like never before. And that’s what I feel. Like never before. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. Greatest employment numbers, greatest stock market, greatest number of jobs any way you want it, greatest industries, greatest creations. And one day we had to close it down. They said, “Sir, we’re going to have to close it down.”
--
Donald Trump: (19:48)
And we did that and everybody suffered, but they did an incredible job, and because of that we’ve saved maybe millions of lives and I just want to thank everybody. This is a scourge around the world. 182 countries as of a week ago, so it’s probably higher. 182 countries are going through relatively the same thing and it’s a very sad chapter. There was no reason for this. There was no reason for this. It should have been stopped at the source, but I’d like to congratulate these incredible five Americans and I’d like to ask them to come forward and receive their award and their recognition and they deserve it. And we’ll be watching you throughout your life. You may be around a little bit longer than me, Mr. Mailman, but I’ll be watching you as long as I can. I’m watching all of you and I want to thank you very much and to my hometown man, thank you very much. Please.
--
Donald Trump: (21:08)
Want to get your instructor up here? Come on. Come on up here. [inaudible 00:21:13] Okay, good. Yeah, you could come up. Why don’t you come up together? You can all come up here if you’d like. I think it would be maybe just as good.
--
Donald Trump: (21:43)
That’s good. Thank you and congratulations.
--
Donald Trump: (21:49)
Yeah, I think so. Let’s do one and then we’ll do one. Okay, let’s take one of us. Thank you very much. You deserve that.
--
Donald Trump: (22:32)
Almost forgot [inaudible 00:22:33]. We won’t let that happen. Thank you, Libby.
--
Donald Trump: (22:44)
So, that was great and you represent a very important part of this country and we appreciate it very much. Thank you very much. Have a good day. Bye. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (00:02)
Indian country.
--
Donald Trump: (00:10)
It’s a very big problem in Alaska. Yeah? Yes.
--
Donald Trump: (00:33)
It is a vast, yeah, it’s a vast land.
--
Donald Trump: (00:46)
I’m going to be signing something in a couple of moments and I hope it helps a lot, not just a little bit, a lot. And I think you’ll do a fantastic job. I know you’re going to be watching it personally and between the three of you and everyone else that I know so well, I think you’re going to do a great job. So go get them.
--
Donald Trump: (01:03)
[inaudible 00:01:03] I’d like to maybe finish off with the Governor. Great governor, you’re doing phenomenal job. What do you have to say, Doug?
--
Donald Trump: (02:50)
Well thank you so much.
--
Donald Trump: (02:52)
One of the other accomplishments we have is in Arizona and a lot of other states, we’re building a wall and you’re finally getting what you need. And interestingly, California’s calling because in bordering towns, as you know, in Mexico they have a very big outbreak of the coronavirus, and California’s calling saying, “You got to help us.” Those are not calls that the media knows about, but that’s the facts.
--
Donald Trump: (03:23)
And in Tijuana, right along the border, they have a tremendous outbreak and we have just completed 172 miles of wall, and it’s real wall, not the kind you were having built over the years that were scoffed at, right? And we’ve done a lot in Arizona and the people letting us know they’re so happy, they’re so thrilled about it.
--
Donald Trump: (03:47)
It’s made a tremendous difference, and we’ve had one of the best months ever in the history of our country for not having people come in that we don’t want, that we don’t want in our country. We want to have the people that come in the right way. So you see the numbers, the numbers are about the best we’ve ever had in the history of the country. So it’s good, but we’re getting that done. I guess you see, do you see where they’re doing it?
--
Donald Trump: (04:12)
It’s a big thing. Up to 172 miles and we’ll have it completed early next year. So it’s been something. Okay, I’m going to sign this. I want to just congratulate you, Myron.
--
Donald Trump: (04:25)
I want to congratulate you. Second lady. That’s so fantastic.
--
Donald Trump: (04:33)
And I want to congratulate you also, because I’ve been in that vicinity and it’s one of the most beautiful places you can imagine. So congratulations very much. Thank you, Steven.
--
Donald Trump: (05:06)
One second, please. One second, please.
--
Donald Trump: (05:11)
I want to make sure everybody looks good except me. I’m going to hand this to the Second Lady, okay, if you don’t mind.
--
Donald Trump: (05:25)
Go ahead, please. Please, sitting. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (08:04)
Thank you very much, Steven. I appreciate it. I have to say, Myron Lizer and I have dealt and our people have dealt together very closely, and the Second Lady, and a lot of progress has been made and we’ll continue to make a lot of progress. I think you’ll see that, and I think you’re going to see it not only here but in the future. Thank you very much, and I appreciate it very much. Thank you. Governor.
--
Donald Trump: (08:27)
And I don’t have to thank you. You’re with the administration. He has good genes, though, you know. He’s got good genes, right? The Scalia genes. You don’t get better than that, do you?
--
Donald Trump: (08:45)
Well, I think we’re looking at phase two and we’re looking at other phases. The country’s starting to open up. The taskforce has done a phenomenal job. We have a chart that I just showed somebody. We just got it this morning as I was getting off the plane. Governor Ducey can explain it better than anybody. When we came in, ventilators were a very, very big deal and very hard to produce.
--
Donald Trump: (09:10)
I say, but it is largely true, the complexity is sort of like building a car. We opened up operations all over the country to build them and there hasn’t been one person that needed a ventilator that didn’t get it, which is amazing and now we’re helping other countries and we’re stockpiling in case some tragedy like this happens again.
--
Donald Trump: (09:30)
But this just came out on testing, because I think we are at the point or maybe we’ll soon be at the point where I can say the exact same thing on testing. These numbers we just released and this is the United States, the amount of testing, and our level of testing and the quality of testing. This is just from Abbott Laboratories. You know what this one is, Jim. It’s a five-minute test.
--
Donald Trump: (09:55)
It’s a great test. It’s something people like because you don’t have to go through a laboratory. Send it in and send it back, and it takes a couple of days if they do a good job. So this is the testing, and the line here is United States. We’re over 7 million tests. Germany is at two and a half. Italy is less than that. Japan is down here and South Korea, which we talk about, and again, I’m very friendly with South Korea, and with the president of South Korea, and he calls to congratulate us on our great testing. South Korea is over here.
--
Donald Trump: (10:28)
One of the reasons we have more cases than any other country by far is because we test much more. So if you test, you’re going to have more cases. If we tested down here, we wouldn’t have very many cases. They like to say we have more cases than anybody, but the fact is when you look at these numbers, and this is the official count, now I can’t tell you whether or not other countries are giving us the straight deal, but I can say that I know one thing, it’s only going to be on the high side, not going to be on the low side.
--
Donald Trump: (10:58)
So this is the other countries. These are the United States and it’s incredible. Remember this, and I think it’s important to say this, Jim, the quality of our test is also the best. I mean, it’s acknowledged to be the best. So again, when we have cases, and we have more cases than anybody else, does anybody really believe that we have more cases than China, but they don’t talk about numbers like this and other countries. But we report everything and …
--
Donald Trump: (11:26)
… I just want to say that we’ve done an incredible job on testing. With that being said, we have some additional, including antibody tests coming out, that will even blow these numbers away, but nobody’s done the job we’ve done. Go ahead.
--
Donald Trump: (11:47)
We will have certain people, as an example, we have hospitals that we built, we have medical centers that we built, we have people on the taskforce that focused on that. We have people on the taskforce that’s focused exclusively on ventilators. Well, we have more ventilators now than anybody in the world, and we’re helping France, as you know, we’re helping France, Italy, Spain, Nigeria. We’re giving, I think, 250 to Nigeria.
--
Donald Trump: (12:13)
We have many countries that we’re helping, but the ventilator problem is solved, so you don’t need that. Now we’re different. It’s sort of a combination of safety and reopening, so we’ll have something in a different form, but the taskforce for what we’ve done, I think everybody out there when they’re being very honest, I think the job we’ve done on testing will shortly be, and maybe even supersede, the job that we’ve done on ventilators, which people can’t even believe.
--
Donald Trump: (12:42)
We had a call the other day with the governors, Mike Pence took the call, and they had, I believe, all 50 governors, and it was, they say, the best call we’ve had thus far. We’re working closely with the governors. They have everything they need and if they don’t have it and if they don’t need it or if they can’t get it locally, then they know that we are stocked and we are ready.
--
Donald Trump: (13:04)
As an example, we won’t need this, but we were ready for weeks. We had 10,000 ventilators sitting in various locations with people by the ventilators ready to have those ventilators roll if they needed them in, as an example, Detroit or various other places over the country. So I think that as far as the taskforce, Mike Pence and the taskforce have done a great job, but we’re now looking at a little bit of a different form and that form is safety and opening and we’ll have a different group probably set up for then.
--
Donald Trump: (13:40)
No. No, not at all. Their mission accomplished is when it’s over. When it’s over, Jim, mission accomplished. No, I wouldn’t just say that at all.
--
Donald Trump: (13:48)
What?
--
Donald Trump: (13:54)
What does that mean? Go ahead. Repeat your question. Say it.
--
Donald Trump: (13:59)
We have great advice. We have great people. We have great people. Yeah, we have great doctors, we have great medical people, laboratory people. I have to say, I think tremendous progress is being made on vaccines, which everybody should be very happy to hear, and therapeutically I think we’re making very good progress too. We’re making tremendous progress. We have the greatest doctors in the world, the greatest laboratories in the world.
--
Donald Trump: (14:30)
I think therapeutically, and also from the standpoint of laboratories, laboratories as it pertains to vaccines, we’re doing very well. I’d love to see a therapeutic answer even before the vaccine, because we could take care of people that have a current problem or dilemma. But therapeutically and for the vaccines, a tremendous amount of progress.
--
Donald Trump: (14:55)
Oxford, Johnson and Johnson, incredible places. … doing, I think, a really good job and they’re very advanced, but we have to now see. … and whoever gets it first, my hats off to them. We’re not looking for first, second, or third. We’re looking to get a vaccine that works and progress has been made.
--
Donald Trump: (15:40)
Well, because we can’t keep our country closed for the next five years. You can say there might be a recurrence and there might be, and most doctors, or some doctors say that it will happen and it’ll be a flame and we’re going to put the flame out. We’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned a lot about the coronavirus. We’ve learned a lot about this hidden enemy. It’s a dangerous enemy, it’s a bad enemy.
--
Donald Trump: (16:03)
You see what it does, especially for people over a certain age and people that have an infirmity. If you have diabetes, if you have a bad heart, if you have a certain problem, it just, Myron, it just goes after you. It’s vicious. And we’re saying that people that are over 60, 65 but over 60 we’re even saying, sort of stay back for a while. We recommend you staying back for a while.
--
Donald Trump: (16:29)
At the same time with young children and children we’d like to see the schools open early next season and on time. It’s very unique how the children aren’t affected but people that have problems and older people can be very badly hurt, injured, or die from this problem.
--
Donald Trump: (17:01)
Well they are looking at it very closely. They are looking at it very closely and I just said it today, I used the word for the first time, I think, in terms of what we’re doing, I’m viewing our great citizens of this country to a certain extent and to a large extent as warriors. They’re warriors. We can’t keep our country closed. We have to open our country.
--
Donald Trump: (17:25)
Somebody said, “Oh, we could keep it for the next 18 months, we could keep it for the next two years.” Doug Ducey’s done an incredible job as the governor of Arizona. The people aren’t going to accept it. They won’t accept it, and they shouldn’t accept it. We have a great country. We can’t keep it closed. I mean, I’ve had doctors say, “Well, why don’t we close it for a couple of years?”
--
Donald Trump: (17:46)
This is the United States of America. I created, with a lot of other very talented people and the people of our country, the greatest economy in the history of the world, the greatest that we’ve ever had, the greatest employment numbers, the best numbers we’ve ever had, the best stock markets. I think we had 144 days of record stock markets, and then one day they said, “We have to close our country.”
--
Donald Trump: (18:11)
Well now it’s time to open it up. And you know what? The people of our country are warriors and I’m looking at it. I’m not saying anything is perfect and yes, will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes, but we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon. Maybe I could ask, Doug, if you’d like to address that point?
--
Donald Trump: (20:18)
Oh, sure. Yeah, they will be and so will other doctors and so will other experts in the field, but we’ve learned a lot. As Doug said, we’ve learned a lot. You could probably have fires here, Doug. You’ll put them out. You’re going to put them out and you’ll put them out fast. So yeah, we were bringing our country back and I think what is going to happen, and just said it a little while ago, you’re going to have a third quarter where you’re going to have transitions. You’ll a big, beautiful, hopefully, a very good transition, a very successful transition back into the real world.
--
Donald Trump: (20:53)
And then you’re going to have a fourth quarter that I think is going to do very well. And then I think next year I think we’re going to have one of the best years we’ve ever had because we have stimulus and we have a pent-up demand like I have never seen before. Today’s a very interesting day because it’s my first day out, and Doug reminded me of something. I didn’t do it for that reason, but you said, “This is the first place you stopped when you ran,” when I ran for something that turned out to be a very successful run.
--
Donald Trump: (21:21)
We had tremendous crowds, you remember at the convention center, in Phoenix and it was pretty incredible. I didn’t do it for that reason, interestingly, but here we are and it was great that you remind us of that fact. But look, we’re going to have a very interesting transition period into the fourth quarter. I think your fourth quarter is going to be very good and I think next year is going to be one of the best years economically we’ve ever had.
--
Donald Trump: (21:47)
With that said, for those people that have lost somebody, for the people that have lost a loved one, even a close friend, nothing can ever happen that’s going to replace that. I don’t care what kind of a year you have from an economic standpoint, nobody’s ever going to replace that. But I think from an economic standpoint, purely an economic standpoint, I think next year’s potentially going to be one of the best years we’ve had.
--
Donald Trump: (22:13)
There’s tremendous stimulus out there and people want to get out. They want to go and they want to go to town. This country was founded on certain principles and those principles are at work like you’ve never seen before. So I want to thank you all very much. Thank you. And we’ll see you perhaps at the next stop. Thank you.
--
Donald Trump: (22:40)
What about it?
--
Donald Trump: (22:46)
Will I take it?
--
Donald Trump: (22:47)
If they would like me to, I’d go the first one or I’d go the last one. I don’t want to waste it, but he’s just saying, if there’s a vaccine, would you take it? And she might like it that it didn’t work too well, okay? But that’s okay. I would absolutely, Jim. If there’s a vaccine and if they wanted me to be first on line, I’d be first on line, or it’d be last on line, or I wouldn’t take it at all. Whatever’s best for the country. Thanks guys. Okay? Thank you.

Donald Trump: (00:00)
In the fantastic state of Arizona. I love Arizona. With the incredible…I had some good moments here, especially on election day. It was a good moment, right? But they’re incredible patriotic and hardworking men and women of Honeywell. Moments ago we saw the brand new production lines where you’re making high quality N95 respirators and they are made to perfection, there’s no bad masks like various countries have been sent some very bad mass from other places. There’s nothing like that at Honeywell. Respirators are there to protect our heroic doctors and nurses as they fight the unseen enemy. More than 150 Honeywell employees are working around the clock. Three shifts a day, six days a week. You are the greatest industrial, and think of this, what you’ve done, you’re part of this incredible industrial mobilization. The biggest since World War II, hard to believe for an invisible enemy, but it’s a vicious enemy. Smart enemy.
--
Donald Trump: (01:10)
Like generations of Patriots before you, the workers of this factory are pouring their heart in this all in their blood into defending our nation and keeping our people healthy and safe. You make America proud. We really do and I want to thank you very much. That’s why I’m here. I want to thank also the entire leadership team at Honeywell, including Darius, who’s, again, fantastic man and Madden, Mike Mattson, John Waldron, Jim Carroll, Brian Roddick, William Lang, Tony Stallings, and Ramina Canon Shaw. In normal times, it would take nine months to stand up one facility like this, but Honeywell has built this in less than five weeks, creating 500 new jobs in Arizona and another 500 jobs in Rhode Island. Together, these new factories will student produced more than 20 million N95 respirators every single month. A truly miraculous achievement. We’re grateful to be joined by secretary of labor, Jean Scalia and governor Doug Doosey. What a fantastic governor he is. Where is Doug? Where is Doug? Thank you Doug. Doing a fantastic job.
--
Donald Trump: (02:39)
He already won his election by like 17 points, so I don’t have to praise him too much, but I will say that he has been a fantastic governor, and that’s … People recognize it. That’s why he had what they say is a walk. It’s very good. We’re proud of you. Doug and anything we can do, you’re going to call me. We don’t have to worry about, he calls me plenty. He calls me plenty because he’s doing his job, but I want to thank you both, and Jean, the job you’re doing is fantastic. Thank you both very much. We appreciate it. Thank you Jean.
--
Donald Trump: (03:13)
I also want to express my appreciation to Senator Martha McSally. Fantastic person. Fantastic person. She’s fighting to uncover the full truth about the China situation and how the World Health Organization handled the outbreak and what happened. There must be transparency and accountability. Martha’s also somebody that is bringing tremendous amounts of dollars back to her state that she loves so much, the state of Arizona, and I know the governor appreciates it very much, Martha, and I appreciate it very much too. You’re doing a fantastic job in good luck. Good luck. Thank you. As well to Betty and Jorge Revis at Sammie’s Mexican Grill in Catalina. Where are they? They’re around here someplace. They’re great.
--
Donald Trump: (04:08)
Where’s the … Come on up here. Come on up here. Come on. Say a couple of words. Say these people … I saw them on television, I saw them on television. They were being devastated by what happened. And I put out a simple tweet saying what wonderful people they are. And they became very rich. They had lines that went around the block. Say a few words, please. Come on. There’s a mic right over here. I can’t believe I have to socially distance myself from these two people. They’re probably the ones that want it from me. Please say a few words.
--
Donald Trump: (05:21)
I really appreciate it. That’s brilliant. That’s beautiful. Go ahead. You can pull that down.
--
Donald Trump: (05:46)
Wow, that’s great. Thank you. That’s fantastic. So today they took care of 150 health care workers at Davon Gables Assisted Living Facility in Tucson and they’ve been helping a lot of the people here get some good food and they’re sending Donald Trump the bill. I can’t write it off to the government because they wouldn’t like that, but we’re paying for it. So make sure you get me that bill. But we have … They are just two terrific people. Again, I saw them on television and they were having a rough time and now they’re doing great. Everybody knows who they are and they have lines of people wanting to get in. Food is supposed to be fantastic. To defeat the virus, we are harnessing the unrivaled power of American industry. We’re using the Defense Production Act to manufacture over 100,000 additional ventilators on top of our fast growing national supply. We’ve mobilized our country. Ventilators are very hard to make, very complex, big, very expensive.
--
Donald Trump: (06:49)
We are now at a point where everybody in this country that’s dated a ventilator, right Doug? Has gotten one, especially here in Arizona, everywhere. And Doug’s had some extra ones and he sent them to other places where they needed some help. But we have gotten ventilators to everybody and now we’re actually helping other nations and we’re using them for stockpiles in case this horror show ever happens again, but not a single American who’s needed it. I mean, I’m so proud of that. Because when people, when we started, we started with, I use the expression the cupboards were bare. That means ventilators, that means a lot of other things. So we’re doing something very dramatic and there’s never been … There hasn’t been anything like what we’ve done since a mobilization since World War II. We’ve dramatically accelerated development of new therapies and potential vaccines.
--
Donald Trump: (07:41)
Johnson and Johnson, Oxford, great places, and we have 90 clinical trials underway and hundreds more on the way and something’s going to happen. Tremendous progress is being made. I don’t want to talk about it until it’s there. We don’t want to talk too soon, but I will say, Doug, they really are. They’re really … Darius, they’re really making progress. You know some of the companies that great companies, you know the Johnson and Johnson folks that have been really fantastic, they want to get to it fast, so we’ll see how it all comes out and we’ll all know very soon and I think it’s going to be a very positive event. Through FEMA, HHS, and our private sector partners we’re equipping our frontline medical workers with more than 70 million N95 respirators, 112 million surgical masks, seven million face shields, 18 million gowns, and nearly one billion gloves.
--
Donald Trump: (08:40)
Today we hear from a few of Honeywell’s extraordinary workers who are leading the charge to equip our healthcare heroes and Marshall are manufacturing Mike. That’s what it is. It’s a manufacturing might that we haven’t seen for a long time. Bruno Aguina worked at another company for 22 years, but he jumped at the chance to support America and America’s war against the virus right here at Honeywell. He’s wanted to work at Honeywell always, and he had his chance. Now is a first shift team leader. Bruno, please come up and say a few words. Bruno? Thanks Bruno.
--
Donald Trump: (10:33)
Thank you Bruno. Great job. Thank you very much, Bruno. And the next time I’m here I think we’ll be … We’ll shake hands and we’ll hug each other for the job he’s doing. Okay, Bruno? Thank you very much. Ursula Warner is a proud air force veteran who courageously served our nation in Afghanistan and all around the world. Now she is continuing her legacy of service right here in Phoenix. Ursula, please come up and tell us how you chose Honeywell and why did you do that.
--
Donald Trump: (12:51)
She was retired for about two days. Retired? Look how young you are. Retired. Thank you very much. Great job Ursula. Eric Parks is a Marine Corps veteran and the operations manager at Honeywell’s new facility. This is a highly personal mission for Eric. His mother is a nurse. His mother-in-law’s a nurse, his brother is a paramedic and his daughter is about to start our first year of medical school at the University of Arizona. That’s one of the great schools. Eric, please come up. Please. Thank you.

Donald Trump: (14:53)
Thank you. As you know, this terrible plague has inflicted grave hardships on our people. We mourn for every life lost. We pray for every victim and we shoulder this burden together as one people, one family and one great American nation. Thanks to the profound commitment of our citizens, we’ve flattened the curve and countless American lives have been saved. Our country is now in the next stage of the battle, a very safe, phased and gradual reopening, so reopening of our country. Who would have ever thought we were going to be saying that? A reopening, reopening. One day they came to us and they said, “Sir, we’re going to have to close it down.” We had the greatest economy in history. Darius tell you about that. Greatest economy we’ve ever had, best employment numbers, history of our country, best stock market in the history of our country, most number of jobs, almost 160 million jobs.
--
Donald Trump: (16:09)
We were never even close to that and they said, “Sir, we have to close it down.” It’s a terrible thing, but we did what was right and now we’re reopening our country and it’s going to be something very special. I was saying before that we’re going to have a transition period. Third quarter, it’s going to transition. Fourth quarter is going to be very good. We think very good and I think next year we’re going to have one of the strongest years we’ve had in a long time, and that’s my ambition to get it back to not only where it was, but to beyond where it was, and I just want to thank all of the people at this incredible company and this incredible plant. This pandemic has underscored the vital importance of reshoring our supply chains and constructing a powerful domestic manufacturing base. I’ve been talking about that for a long time.
--
Donald Trump: (17:06)
Oftentimes you’d see a plant like this in a different country doing the work you could be doing and you’ll do it better. The United States declared its independence nearly 250 years ago, but in recent decades, Washington politicians allowed our independence to be offshored, outsourced, and seated to foreign countries, but we’re taking it back and we’ve been taking it back. Then you look at our job numbers, you knew that we were taking it back. When we got up to almost 160 million something had to be happening. One of the things that happened was we were taking it back.
--
Donald Trump: (17:43)
We know it matters where something is made and we want essential medicine supplies and equipment to be manufactured, produced, and made right here in the good old USA. My administration believes in two simple rules. Buy American and hire American. In the 20th century, Honeywell workers helped make America the world’s greatest manufacturing super power. It is a great company and it played a very big role. Now in the 21st century right here in Phoenix, Arizona, you’re reclaiming the noble heritage and writing the next chapter of this incredible American story, and you have a great governor to lead your way and you have a great Senator to lead your away.
--
Donald Trump: (18:33)
You have a lot of people that are leading your way. It was the men and women of Honeywell whose craftsmanship made it possible for Charles Lindbergh to fly across the Atlantic and for Amelia Earhart to break boundaries in the sky. It was the men and women of Honeywell who built the periscopes, mortar sites and autopilot systems that powered American warriors as they battle the forces of tyranny and fought to victory in the second world war, and it was the unstoppable workers right here at Honeywell that helped our brave astronauts plant our American flag on the face of the moon, and we’re getting ready to do it again, but we’re really using the moon as a landing pad for its journey and our journey together to Mars that’s happening very soon. Now it is one more time for the men and women of Honeywell who are supplying the weapons, the armor, the sweat, and the skill in a war to defeat the new invisible enemy. A tough enemy, a smart enemy, but nobody’s like us and nobody’s tough like us.
--
Donald Trump: (19:46)
I said it before and I’ll say it again. The people of our country are warriors. With your help, we will vanquish the virus and build a future of greatness and glory with American heart, American hands, American pride, and American soul. Thank you very much for the incredible job you do. Thank you to Honeywell, to our Senator, to our governor. Thank you so much for the incredible job you do and thank you to the people of Arizona. We will never forget. Thank you very much. Thank you.
